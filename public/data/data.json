Oberweis found that he had too much milk so he began selling it to neighbors. In essence, the family dairy business that now spans almost 100 years had begun. <br/><br/>The Oberweis family has been delivering milk to homes since 1927 when Peter bought a half partnership in the Big Woods Dairy. A few years later he bought the entire enterprise, renamed it Oberweis Dairy and his high school son Joe left school to help out. During the Depression refrigeration was inefficient. Milk could be safely kept only a few days thus necessitating daily home delivery. <br/><br/>During the war, when gas rationing was in effect, refrigeration had improved so delivery was changed to every other day. By the mid 1920's home delivery was being made in a Model T. <br/><br/>We're still delivering bright and early. We're still using glass bottles, because we don't think milk should taste like plastic...just milk, pure and simple. We don't believe in adding anything unnecessary to our milk either. That's why none of our farmers use the rBGH hormone on their cows. <br/><br/>We're still family owned and operated too. What's more, we stick to what got us here...Peter Oberweis' lifelong commitment to quality and service. <br/><br/>Over the years we've gone from the nostalgic horse and milk cart to the Model T to the milk trucks of the 50's and on to more modern home delivery trucks you see us use today. <br/><br/>We've built a bigger, better facility, expanded our product line and opened retail stores where folks can come in for our award-winning milk in glass bottles and our super-premium ice cream.<br/><br/>Whether we deliver right to your door, or you visit one of our dairy stores, you can be confident that our quality and service will always be \"Simply the Best\". <br/><br/>That's the way Peter Oberweis wanted it, and we're chips off the old block.<br/><br/>Call us at (630) 801-6100 to sign-up for an Oberweis Plant Tour. You'll get to see where we make our world-famous milk and ice cream! You'll see a video of all the behind-the-scenes action at Oberweis Dairy including the farms where our rGBH hormone free cows live, the Oberweis Milkman and our plant.

When a customer purchases a Longaberger basket, they also are sharing in the Longaberger story and family tradition. The Company?s mission statement ? ?To Stimulate A Better Quality Of Life? ? reflects Longaberger?s commitment to the Company?s founding philosophy that people are the key to our success. We are a family-owned Company with a family-friendly environment. <br/><br/>The Longaberger History<br/>In 1896, when the Longaberger family moved to Dresden, Ohio, the tiny village still enjoyed its prosperity as a rural transportation and industrial hub in the rolling foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. There was a hotel on Main Street, three railroad stations, a woolen mill and a paper mill. In the not-too-distant past, a side-cut canal had connected the community with the historic Ohio Canal, transforming the village into a bustling canal town.<br/><br/>In the early 1900s, baskets were as commonplace as paper bags and plastic containers are now. Ware Baskets, made at the Dresden Basket Factory, were used to carry pottery ware for the region's booming pottery industry. <br/><br/>In 1919, J.W. Longaberger (Dave?s father) took a job with the Dresden Basket Factory. As a full-time apprentice he meticulously learned the basketmaking art by first crafting basket bottoms. Later he mastered the precise, tight weaving style that would become his trademark. J.W. grew to love the art of basketry.<br/><br/>While working at the basket factory, J.W. met Bonnie Jean Gist from the neighboring community of Trinway. Their courtship led to marriage in 1927. During the Great Depression, the Dresden Basket Factory closed. J.W. found work at the local paper mill, but continued making baskets after work and on weekends. In 1936, J.W. and Bonnie purchased the closed Dresden Basket Factory and the home on that property. J.W. then named his new business The Ohio Ware Basket Company, reflecting the importance of Ware Baskets and the pottery industry to his small side business. <br/><br/>The Longaberger family eventually grew to include 12 children ? six boys and six girls. Bonnie worked full time at the woolen mill to help make ends meet and the older children helped their father by making basket bottoms, carefully arranging the up-splints for pottery Ware Baskets and even selling baskets to the neighbors. <br/><br/>In 1934, a fifth child was born to J.W. and Bonnie ? Dave Longaberger. Early in life, Dave had three strikes against him. His family was economically disadvantaged, he stuttered so badly people had difficulty understanding him, and he had epilepsy in a time when the condition was not widely understood.<br/><br/>Dave's liabilities did not stand in the way of his ambition, however. As a youngster he worked in a grocery store, shoveled snow, delivered papers, mowed grass and hauled trash. He ran the projectors at the local movie house. Because Dave was always making money from one job or another, his family called him the \"25-cent millionaire.\" <br/><br/>At age 21, Dave finally graduated from high school. He began his career by driving a bread truck for several years for two different bakeries. From 1961-62, Dave served in the U.S. Army. <br/><br/>In the early 60s, his first daughter Tami was born, and Dave grew anxious to take the many lessons he had learned over the years to work for his own business and family. In 1963, when Harry's Dairy Bar in Dresden came up for sale, Dave and his wife bought it. The restaurant had two booths, two tables and eight stools. Later Dave also purchased the defunct A&amp;P Grocery in town, remodeled and expanded the building, and opened the Dresden IGA Foodliner. As always, Dave worked very hard during those years, and between both businesses he earned a solid living for his family, which now also included younger daughter Rachel.<br/><br/>In the early 1970s, Dave noticed that baskets were becoming very popular, and he also noticed that many department stores were beginning to sell imported baskets. Dave wondered if people would appreciate baskets like the fine handcrafted ones his father used to make. He asked his father to make a dozen market baskets, and then took them to a nearby town. They sold immediately and the shop requested more! J.W. made several dozen more baskets. Sadly, however, J.W. died at the age of 71, just as the family trade was being renewed. <br/><br/>Dave opened J.W.'s Handwoven Baskets? in 1976 in Dresden. Interest in these beautiful handmade baskets continued to grow, until Dave had to find a place in which to expand his small basket factory. He found a very unlikely building: the old woolen mill where his mother had worked, built in the 1890s. It had stood vacant since 1955, and had broken windows, uneven floors and a sagging roof. The brick walls were all that remained solid and strong of the facility. In this dilapidated building, Dave envisioned a basket factory with hundreds of craftsmen and craftswomen weaving, tacking, talking and laughing. He had proven to himself from his previous business ventures that he had a knack for envisioning the unlikely, so he approached his new venture with great enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Dave became increasingly convinced that American consumers wanted the handmade craftsmanship and quality of Longaberger baskets. He tried different ways to sell baskets at malls, department stores and other retails outlets, with varying degrees of success. In 1978, Dave discovered that the most effective way to sell the company?s baskets was not through retail outlets but through home shows, where an educated basket associate could show Longaberger baskets and share the history and explain the craftsmanship that each basket holds. The Longaberger Company?s direct sales organization was born.<br/><br/>In 1984, Dave?s daughter Tami joined the Company full-time after her graduation from The Ohio State University. Tami worked in virtually every area of the company, and in 1994 Dave appointed her president. Working side by side until Dave's death in 1999, Tami learned her father?s management principles first-hand. Clearly cut from the same visionary cloth as her father, she used her own extraordinary gifts to diversify the company into other home lifestyle areas, which now account for nearly half of the company?s revenues.<br/><br/>Under Tami?s leadership, collectors have developed a passion for baskets and the Company has experienced consistent annual growth. The Company has been featured for its cutting edge employee programs and outstanding corporate citizenship. Dave?s younger daughter Rachel carries on the family?s tradition of philanthropy by heading The Longaberger Foundation, which has donated millions to local charities and educational institutions since its inception in 1998.<br/><br/>Today, The Longaberger Company is the premier maker of handmade baskets in the United States, employing nearly 7,000 craftsmen and craftswomen as well as professional support staff and 70,000 Independent Sales Associates. Under the direction of CEO and President Tami Longaberger, the Company has grown to a $1 billion organization and diversified into product lines including wrought iron, pottery and fabric accessories. The Longaberger name is synonymous with quality; our baskets are handmade to be handed down and home accessory items add pleasure and functionality to the home.<br/><br/>Longaberger is one of Forbes magazine's top privately held companies. The Company was recognized as the 18th largest woman ? owned company in the U.S. by Working Woman magazine and has been cited by Newman?s Own, Inc. and George magazine as one of the Top 10 Most Generous Companies in America.<br/> <br/>Longaberger travel destinations include our basket-shaped Home Office, our manufacturing tour and Longaberger Homestead, our shopping, dining and entertainment complex.<br/><br/>Basketmakng Tour ? Guests can tour the 880,000 square-foot basketmaking facility from the mezzanine above and watch how each of the company's baskets are individually crafted by hand.

These original Grady-Whites were handcrafted in the Carolina tradition with wide beams, flared bows, and wooden lapstrake hulls. They earned a reputation for exceptional seaworthiness in those pre-electronics days when coastal fishermen found fish with a compass and needed safe, dependable performance in the roughest of conditions. <br/><br/>The Smith family purchased Grady-White Boats in 1968, and finished the conversion to building boats with longlasting fiberglass. Chairman and CEO Eddie Smith, Jr., has provided continuous leadership since that time. Over the years, we've pioneered many innovations that keep us at the leading edge of sportfishing engineering. <br/><br/>In 1975, we introduced the walkaround cabin design offering easy access forward for fishing and anchoring plus the protection of a cabin and full windshield. Today we make walkaround cabins ranging from 20'-30', 26' and 33' express cabin models, center consoles ranging from 18' to 30' and 19' and 22' dual consoles. In 1981, the 9'6\"-beam Sailfish 25 heralded the trend toward big, beamy outboard powered boats. In 1989, we broke the 30-foot barrier with the Marlin 300. The 1990s unveiled our \"secret weapon\" hull technology, the SeaV2 series designed exclusively for us by C. Raymond Hunt Associates. And in 2001, we introduced our new flagship, the Express 330, an elegant outboard-powered 33-footer that lives up to the Grady-White legacy of superior performance. Grady-White now builds 18 boat models from 18' to 33'. </div> "}, "id": "2LMFS8NF8CAXV4M9"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/iowa/hansens-farm-fresh-dairy", "City": "Test", "Name": "Hansen?s Farm Fresh Dairy", "Longitude": -92.4755758, "State/Province": "Iowa", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 42.3931509, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Owned and operated by the Hansen family since 1861, the Farm Fresh Dairy offers guests a hands-on tour of the working farm and dairy.<br/><br/>In addition to the usual farm sights, from baby calves to milking parlors to cow barns, guests can also see the creamery, the Hansen farm equipment and even domesticated wallabies that live on the farm.

Wade Morrison?s Old Corner Drug Store was a prominent business and popular meeting place in downtown Waco. People came in for everything from flea powder to stationery, from cigars to fountain drinks.<br/><br/>One of Morrison?s employees, pharmacist Charles Alderton, noticed how customers loved the smell of the soda fountain with its many fruit, spice and berry aromas. He wanted to invent a drink that tasted the wonderful way the soda fountain smelled. After much experimentation he finally felt he had hit on ?something different.? Patrons at the drug store agreed.<br/><br/>Soon other soda fountains were buying the syrup from Morrison and serving it. People loved the new unnamed drink and would order it by simply calling out ?shoot me a Waco!? But Morrison named it Dr Pepper, after the father of a girl he had loved back in his home state of Virginia.<br/><br/>In 1891 Morrison and new partner Robert Lazenby organized the Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Company in order to bottle and sell Dr Pepper as well as other soft drinks. That same year, while visiting Waco, a Texas businessman by the name of Sam Houston Prim tasted the new fountain drink and knew he wanted to sell it in his bottling plant in Dublin, Texas, 80 miles to the west.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Mr. Lazenby Dr Pepper enjoyed steady growth in sales and began to spread in popularity across the country. But it wasn?t until 1904 that Dr Pepper gained real national exposure. Along with other soon to be favorites like ice cream cones and hamburgers, Dr Pepper was introduced to the rest of the U. S. and the entire world at the 1904 World?s Fair in St. Louis.<br/><br/>Since then Dr Pepper?s popularity has grown consistently over the years to become one of the top 3 soft drinks in the United States and the No. 1 non-cola.

They begin with fresh, spring-fed mountain water from the Laurel Run Reservoir, which lies along the Eastern Continental Divide. As the water runs into the brewery, it is mixed with cornflakes and malted barley. This mixture is heated, producing a sweet golden syrup called wort, which is slowly drawn through a copper vessel slot or grant, where they visually inspect the beer for clarity and color. <br/><br/>Next they add hops and transfer the wort to the brew kettle, where it is boiled for two hours. The heated product is held for a short time in a separate vessel, then cooled as it passes through the Cold Plate Cooler at the rate of one barrel per minute.<br/><br/>The fermenting process begins with the addition of liquid yeast to the \"green\" beer. This process takes seven to ten days, during which time the yeast will consume the fermentable sugars in the wort, producing beer and, as a by-product, carbon dioxide, which is collected and filtered.<br/><br/>After the fermentation process is completed, they transfer the beer to cold storage for aging (which can last two weeks) and double cold filtering. At this time the filtered carbon dioxide is injected into the beer (polishing) supplying the refreshing zest for which Straub Beer has always been famous. Their brewing process is virtually unchanged since Peter Straub perfected it in 1872. <br/> </div> "}, "id": "4Q8EO3T5EVJ8Z4WE"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/mepps-sheldons-inc", "City": "Test", "Name": "Mepps / Sheldons', Inc.", "Longitude": -89.150291, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 45.157612, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Metal Manufacturing", "Description": " The American Home of Mepps / Sheldons', Inc., the world headquarters for Mepps, the world's #1 lure, is located at 626 Center St. on the north side of Antigo, Wisconsin.

She had discovered that even the mildest of soaps was made of petrochemicals rather than natural ingredients. Searching the Internet, she came upon soap recipes and began testing them.<br/><br/>?That first recipe resulted in a soap that was truly disgusting, but I soon found one that would work much better,? she said. LaRee, a real estate attorney, had returned to college to study chemistry to become a plant patent attorney as well. She came to understand the chemistry of soap making.<br/><br/>She learned that coconut oil or palm kernel oil would produce a hard, long-lasting bar with a fluffy lather and that soy oil would create a stable lather with conditioning qualities.She learned that olive oil, a natural skin softener, would moisturize the skin. She found books that taught her the chemical equations for formulating soap recipes that would result in different desirable characteristics.<br/><br/>She researched the sources of natural ingredients, from the lye and oils that would serve as the basis for soap to the essential oils that would provide the scents. She realized that most people don?t understand the difference between essential oils derived from actual plants and manufactured synthetic fragrances.<br/><br/>?In searching the Web, I soon realized that, although there are a number of soap makers listed, there are only perhaps five percent that really use nothing butall-natural ingredients,? she said. ?While there?s nothing wrong with using chemicals to make soap, it has been important to me from the beginning that our soap be made completely of natural plant-based ingredients.?<br/><br/>At Christmas, LaRee gave bars of her soap to relatives and friends. That first soap was a mild citrus soap?with essential oils of orange, lemongrass and tangerine. It smelled great and the response was overwhelming. ?Everyone loved it so much that I thought?maybe I?ve really got something here,? she thought.<br/><br/>Her husband, graphic artist and marketing expert Ken Gilberg thought so, too. Together they began making soap in earnest and named the new company Herbaria. Their first commercial customer was Gilberg Perennial Farm, owned and run by Ken?s sister-in-law Cindy Gilberg. When sales proved to be quite good in 2001, Cindy suggested that they apply to participate in Missouri Botanical Garden?s Best of Missouri which features state products made and sold by entrepreneurs from Kansas City to St. Louis.<br/><br/>?At first, the co-chairman of Best of Missouri said that applications had already closed for the October 2002 event. I said ?let me send you a couple of bars of our soap and see how you like it?,? said LaRee. ?A few days later, she called and said ?you?re in!?<br/><br/>?That meant that we had to hustle,? Ken said. ?We wanted to make 3,000 bars of soap in time to take to Best of Missouri. We made it. I think we sold over half of them.?<br/><br/>LaRee worked about 12 hours a day during the heat of summer to make enough soap for that first major push. She was making four batches a day. Her father had made mold boxes of some beautiful old wood. ?They were works of art,? she said. ?Each one would hold 54 bars of soap, so I made the recipe batches to fit that number. I would cut the bars apart with an antique butcher knife that my great-aunt had given me.?<br/><br/>A week before Best of Missouri, LaRee agreed to take a new job in real estate law that would begin the day after the show. Since the new job would be very demanding, she would be unable to devote as much time to the growing soap business. Ken, with over 30 years of experience in marketing, saw great opportunity for Herbaria. He added his own touches to the products. He standardized the bar size and designed new packaging and displays. He increased sales calls to businesses in the region and soon boosted production to 30,000 bars a year.<br/><br/>Following the success of their sales at Best of Missouri, the two expanded their horizons. Although LaRee wouldn?t be able to be as active, she remained an important member of the team, coming up with new recipes and scent combinations. The next big customer was the gift shop at the Gateway Arch. And those sales led to more sales at other national parks. The soaps sold in the national park shops were made with a focus on the 19th century in keeping with the emphasis on both the Civil War and Lewis &amp; Clark.<br/><br/>The Bug Store, a St. Louis institution with two successful locations, became a loyal customer. The Greentree Shop at the Kirkwood Public Library also became a good customer. When LaRee heard about the children?s summer reading programs at the library Herbaria gave 400 bars of peppermint soap to be used as incentives, each bar awarded for 20 hours of reading.<br/><br/>?At about that time, I realized we would have to make some changes in our procedures if we were to grow,? Ken said. ?We now manufacture our soaps in cubic-foot molds made of plastic lumber. After waiting two days for the soap to become solid, we cut it into loaves with special jigs fitted with guitar strings. Then the loaves are cut into bars with another guitar-string jig. The soap bars cure for two weeks and then are ready to wrap and pack.?<br/><br/>?The two-week curing period represents the finalization of the chemical process that transforms acids from fat and alkalies from sodium hydroxide (lye) into a salt that we call soap,? said LaRee. ?Herbaria soaps are made the old-fashioned way that retains the naturally occurring glycerin. They are super-fatted with shea butter, avocado oil, hemp seed oil or jojoba to attain an even more moisturizing quality.?<br/><br/>Ken has expanded the sales of Herbaria soaps to include the Missouri Historical Society and also a number of bed and breakfasts. In addition, sales from the Herbaria web site have increased to include orders from all over the United States.<br/><br/>?We hope to get sales up to over 60,000 bars a year,? Ken said. ?Our product line now includes a natural citronella bar, an old-fashioned lye soap bar that is great for shampooing, and a bar with almond essential oil. Lavender Oatmeal and Spearmint Orange are the top two sellers of all our soaps.? </div> "}, "id": "4XPG0X0Z0V83LSLG"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/tennessee/gibson-guitar-factory", "City": "Test", "Name": "Gibson Guitar  Factory", "Longitude": -90.053168, "State/Province": "Tennessee", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.138749, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Take the Gibson guided tour with a knowledgeable \"honest to goodness\" musician.

Carl, Jr., a fourth generation building contractor, as a speculative venture aimed at developing the first commercial-type range specifically designed, engineered and certified for home use. <br/><br/>The idea of developing a commercial-type range for home use resulted from Carl noticing the increasing use of commercial ranges in residential kitchens during the late 1970s. Recognizing the need for such a product became even more apparent when Carl was designing and building his new home in 1980. The typical stainless steel restaurant range strongly appealed to Carl and his wife wanted a heavy-duty, classic looking range like her mother?s old Chambers, which had long been out of production.<br/><br/>As he considered the possibility of using a standard commercial range in their home, Carl became convinced that restaurant ranges were definitely not designed for home use. Among the numerous disadvantages which made those undesirable and impractical for installation in a residential kitchen were: high heat output and extremely hot surface temperatures, no safety features, excessive energy consumption, constantly burning standing pilot instead of automatic ignition, no broiling in the oven, and dimensions which were not designed for typical residential cabinetry. <br/><br/>Carl became convinced that the ideal solution would be a hybrid range that would combine the most desirable features of both a commercial range and the old Chambers range his wife so badly wanted. This left him with a dilemma ? he realized both he and his wife wanted something that didn?t exist. But he also saw this as an opportunity. If no one was making such a product, why shouldn?t he? So he decided to pursue the idea of creating the world?s first heavy duty, commercial-type range for the home. <br/><br/>Carl first conducted a thorough design analysis to identify all the advantages and disadvantages of commercial ranges. 1n 1981 and 1982, while operating his design/build construction company, he used any spare time he had to prepare conceptual drawings and developed detailed specifications which eliminated all the shortcomings of a commercial range for home use while including all their advantages. High performance cooking, large capacity, heavy duty construction and professional styling were all key elements of his design. Carl then added all the desirable features of a high-end residential range, such as automatic ignition, in-the-oven broiling, convenient controls, ample insulation to decrease exterior temperatures and heat output into the kitchen, standard widths and depths to accommodate typical residential cabinetry, and various other functional and cosmetic improvements. To achieve the look of the old Chambers, he included the option of a brilliant white finish in his specifications.<br/><br/>In preparation for taking his product to market, Carl then began establishing the business structure of the venture. In late 1983, with the assistance of a local advertising agency, he named the new company and its product \"Viking\". Carl incorporated Viking Range Corporation on March 22, 1984. The challenge of pioneering and developing the very first commercial-type range for the home had officially begun. <br/><br/>Carl began presenting his drawings and specifications to various commercial range manufacturers, seeking a partner that would aid him in developing and producing a commercial-type range for home use. After being turned down by virtually every major restaurant range manufacturer in the industry, Carl ultimately persuaded a southern California company to assist him with the engineering and to carry out the manufacturing of the first Viking range.<br/><br/>The engineering and certification process of the first Viking range spanned a period of more than three years. Being a hybrid of both commercial and residential equipment, Carl?s Viking range was the first such range to ever be submitted to the American Gas Association laboratories for certification. Because no such product had ever existed or been tested, AGA approval involved over a year of extensive testing and evaluation, including the creation of several new testing criteria. AGA certification was finally obtained in late 1986, and 20 test and sample units were produced in October and November of that year. Normal production of the world?s first commercial-type range for home use finally began in January, 1987.<br/><br/>The unanticipated volume and growth experienced by Viking quickly overwhelmed the capacity and capabilities of the California manufacturer and production was subsequently moved to a household appliance manufacturer in eastern Tennessee that was more accustomed to larger volumes. Although this company provided some degree of improvement, various problems and challenges persisted which were beyond Carl?s control and he knew another change had to be made.<br/><br/>Therefore, in October of 1989, Viking began preparations for manufacturing its own product line in Carl?s hometown of Greenwood, Mississippi, located in the historic Mississippi Delta. By February of 1990, the first Viking-produced range top went into production. Production of the 48-inch range followed in April, and by July 1990, all models were in production in Greenwood. For the first time Viking assumed full responsibility for the in-house manufacture of its own product line.<br/><br/>In July 1992, Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Arkansas, investment banking firm (www.stephens.com), made a major equity investment in Viking Range Corporation. Carl?s new partnership with Stephens allowed Viking to accelerate its rapid growth and to further expand its product line and manufacturing capabilities to keep pace with the increasing demand for its high quality products.<br/><br/>The original Viking manufacturing facility in Greenwood was located in a 35,000 sq. ft. former distribution warehouse (which had been built by Carl?s father in the 1950?s) and served the company?s needs for about two years. However, increased volume and the addition of new products soon stretched the capacity of this small manufacturing facility. In 1992, the decision was made to move to a larger 100,000 sq. ft. plant to accommodate the continued growth of the company. This facility, located on what is now Viking Road, has been enlarged several times in the past few years to approximately 240,000 sq. ft. and is now the Viking cooking products manufacturing plant.<br/><br/>In 1986, the Viking corporate offices were moved from Carl?s cramped construction company office to a partially renovated building on the bank of the Yazoo River in the historic Cotton Row District of downtown Greenwood. As the company continued to grow, Carl expanded his offices within this building and soon filled it. Committed to staying in downtown Greenwood, he then began buying adjoining buildings to house the growing company. The Viking corporate headquarters now consists of a collection of historic buildings totaling over 50,000 square feet. All of the downtown buildings are original structures of the late 1800s and early 1900s, and several have received historic preservation awards from the Mississippi Heritage Trust as well as the National Trust for Historic Preservation Award for commercial district revitalization.<br/><br/>Due to the rapid growth of Viking, keeping up with its facilities needs has been a major challenge. In late 1997, an entirely new plant, now consisting of 90,000 sq. ft., was constructed just outside the western city limits of Greenwood to produce Viking ventilation hoods and certain other specialty products. A third manufacturing facility, the Viking refrigeration products plant, was acquired and totally renovated in 2000. This 143,000 sq. ft. facility, located adjacent to the cooking products manufacturing facility, produces Viking built-in refrigerators and wine storage units. In order to efficiently handle distribution of its ever-expanding product line, Viking also built a distribution center in 2000 and then expanded the building in 2002 for a total of over 80,000 sq. ft. <br/><br/>The Viking dishwasher products manufacturing plant was completed in 2006. This facility totals over 87,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing space. Also in 2006, the Viking product support center was opened in Greenwood to house the Viking service parts and customer assurance department, comprised of service parts distribution, service call center, warranty administration, and technical support staffs. Viking also opened a new tool &amp; die facility with over 10,000 square feet in 2007. The current square footage of all Viking production and distribution facilities in Greenwood is more than 600,000 square feet.<br/><br/>Viking has continued its aggressive new product development initiatives and has expanded its product offerings to encompass the entire kitchen, both indoors and outdoors. In addition to freestanding ranges and ventilation hoods, the current Viking product line includes built-in range tops and cooktops, built-in ovens, warming drawers, dishwashers, trash compactors, food waste disposers, refrigerators, freezers, wine cellars, and an entire line of outdoor products including grills, ovens, refrigeration and stainless steel cabinetry. <br/><br/>Viking sells its major appliance products through 13 residential appliance distributors covering all 50 states and Canada, and these distributors sell to authorized Viking dealers in their territories. In addition, Viking-Europe headquartered in Strasbourg, France, and Viking-Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, now serve 50 international distributors who handle Viking international sales throughout the world. Viking products are now found in more than 80 countries worldwide. The Viking network of independent distributors is regarded as one of the strongest in the major appliance industry.<br/><br/>In 2002, Viking Range Corporation moved into a new market category of premium culinary products (www.vikingrange.com) which has grown to include cookware, cutlery, stand mixers, blenders, toasters, food processors, and hand blenders. The culinary products line continues to expand and is distributed directly to gourmet shop retailers throughout the USA. <br/><br/><br/>Viking considers itself not only a major appliance manufacturer, but a culinary company involved in all aspects of the kitchen and the world of food and wine - The Viking Life. Through cooking classes, gourmet events and online instruction, the Viking Life makes the savory world of Viking tangible.<br/><br/><br/>Viking Cooking Schools offer the USA?s most popular non-academic culinary curriculum in locations throughout the country. There are currently sixteen Viking Cooking School licensees and affiliates with four additional locations scheduled to open by end of year 2009. Over 70, 000 students participated in Viking Cooking School classes in 2008. There are currently over 300 unique classes available for all Viking Cooking School licensees and affiliates which have been developed, written and tested by Viking culinary professionals.<br/><br/>In 2001, Viking began renovations on the historic Hotel Irving in downtown Greenwood. Renamed The Alluvian and designed as an upscale boutique hotel offering unparalleled amenities, the hotel opened to widespread acclaim in May 2003. The Alluvian won the AAA 4-Diamond Award in 2007 and 2008 as well Conde Nast?s Traveler 2008 Gold List and 2004 Hot List. The Alluvian provides luxury accommodations for the many Viking dealers who attend weekly factory training sessions in Greenwood, along with developers, builders, designers, architects and other Viking guests, as well as the general public. <br/><br/>In addition, The Alluvian Spa; Giardina?s Restaurant, a Mississippi Delta dining landmark since 1936; and the Viking Cooking School and Retail Store provide an entertaining and memorable experience, resulting in the renowned Viking facilities becoming a unique and popular tourist destination. <br/><br/>In spite of its tremendous growth and success, Viking Range Corporation remains essentially the same entrepreneurial company it was at its inception. This small, close-knit company culture serves Viking, its customers and its community well, and greatly contributes to the company?s ongoing growth and success. By carefully preserving this unique, creative and stimulating environment, and through offering only the very finest, highest quality products, Viking plans to continue its aggressive growth and expansion to further increase its already strong presence in the worldwide major appliance and related culinary lifestyle industries. </div> "}, "id": "5817MHUZ5HPIHL6Q"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/colorado/anheuser-busch-ft-collins-co", "City": "Test", "Name": "Anheuser-Busch  (Ft Collins, CO)", "Longitude": -105.002032, "State/Province": "Colorado", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 40.617715, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " The Anheuser-Busch Fort Collins brewery Tour and Clydesdale Hamlet is a favorite destination on Colorado's Front Range.

After years of working at various breweries in Europe and Canada, he moved to the United States and, in 1915, bought \"The Little Brewery in Shiner.\" Not a whole lot ever changes in Shiner and that's the way we like it. To this day, we still use Kosmos' original recipes and painstakingly handcraft each brew one at a time making sure that every beer is naturally aged before it leaves the Brewery.<br/><br/>Even our Brewmaster and General Manager, John Hybner, hasn't changed in nearly a quarter of a century. In fact, we still have less than fifty employees. But one thing that has changed is our willingness to share. There was a time when you could only get Shiner Beer in Texas. Now we distribute to 20 other states. So if you live outside Texas, you can drink a toast to Carlos Alvarez, owner of the Brewery, who's responsible for our recent building and market expansion.

There is something about our volcanic soil, Island showers and tropical Hawaiian sun that blesses them with unique flavor that is world renowned. <br/>This is especially true with our totally unique chocolate. We are the ONLY producers to grow and process all-Hawaiian chocolate anywhere on earth. From the 1,300 cacao trees that surround our Keauhou home we process only Big Island grown cocoa beans. Our micro processing factory is the only one in Hawai'i ~ assuring total quality control from the fields to the final chocolate bars. <br/><br/>Don't be misled by other chocolate distributors who claim \"made with...\" (that's a blend), or, \"Made in Hawai'i\"(made with imported beans). There is only ONE chocolate grown, harvested, processed and packaged in Hawai'i ~ from The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory. We invite you to experience our exceptionally unique chocolate. America's own! <br/> <br/>Grown In Hawai'i<br/>================<br/><br/>Pods full of cocoa beans grow directly from the trunk and branches of the 10'-12' trees. As they ripen over a five month period of time the pods go through a colorful evolution from green to yellow or deep maroon to candy apple red. The ripe pods are then handpicked and sliced open. Inside each pod are beans covered with white mucilage that looks and tastes nothing like chocolate. <br/><br/>After extracting the cocoa beans they are fermented in slatted wooden boxes. The beans are then spread out and slowly dried on racks in our Hawaiian sun for 22-28 days. <br/><br/>Made in Hawai'i<br/>===============<br/><br/>The cocoa beans, once sorted and roasted to perfection, are put through a custom built \"flinger\" which removes their shells and leaves the pure chocolate \"nib\". The all-Hawaiian nibs are ground into a chocolate liquor paste inside our highly specialized Conche/Refiner. <br/>At this point cocoa butter, sugar, vanilla powder, and/or milk powder is added ~ depending on whether dark or milk chocolate is being made. <br/><br/>After a second conching of up to 12 hours, lecithin is added to turn the batch into a creamy, rich, pure Hawaiian chocolate fluid. <br/><br/>The chocolate is then tempered and molded ~ creating solid Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory bars. </div> "}, "id": "6R266OZBS6I6FDEP"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/georgia/world-of-coca-cola", "City": "Test", "Name": "World of Coca-Cola", "Longitude": -84.392531, "State/Province": "Georgia", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 33.762541, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " For more than 120 years, we?ve been putting our secret formula into bottles.

Although financial difficulties forced the sale of the uncompleted building to Fox-West Coast Theatres, the firm that completed the theatre and operated it until it closed on September 15, 1970, the name \"Paramount\" was retained. <br/><br/>After its initial brief blaze of \"movie palace\" glory in the 1930's, this remarkable auditorium suffered three decades of neglect and decline until its rescue by the Oakland Symphony, the City of Oakland and numerous private donors. The building was purchased by the Board of Directors of the Oakland Symphony Orchestra Association in 1972. A painstaking and authentic restoration was completed in 1973 and the theatre was entered in the National Register of Historic Places on August 14th of that year. <br/><br/>In 1975 the City of Oakland, the present owner, assumed ownership from the Oakland Symphony Orchestra Association. The Paramount Theatre became a California Registered Historic Landmark in 1976, and on May 5, 1977, was declared a National Historic Landmark. <br/><br/>Restored to its original splendor, meticulously maintained, and fully upgraded to modern technical standards, the Paramount now serves all the arts. The Paramount Theatre is the home of both the Oakland Ballet and the Oakland East Bay Symphony and, as one of the San Francisco Bay Area's premiere performing arts facilities, hosts a year-round schedule of popular music concerts, variety shows, and - of course - movies. </div> "}, "id": "6ZDIZR0NZNVIQM6Q"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/california/kodak-theatre", "City": "Test", "Name": "Kodak Theatre", "Longitude": -118.338826, "State/Province": "California", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 34.10166, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Misc", "Description": " Kodak Theatre is the crown jewel of the Hollywood and Highland entertainment complex located in the heart of historic Hollywood.

His Belgian inspired brews garnered enough praise from friends and neighbors that Jeff and Kim take their basement brewery commercial in 1991.<br/><br/>Kim, social worker by day and mother to two always, began the marketing process by knocking on their neighbor's door.

Wally Byam once said \"let's not make any changes-let's make only improvements.\" And that's exactly what we have been doing for over 70 years. <br/><br/>Airstream began with a single man and a most singular dream. The man was Wally Byam: his dream, to build the perfect travel trailer. One that would move like a stream of air. One that would be light enough to be towed by a standard automobile. One that would provide first-class living accommodations anywhere in the world. Thus, over 70 years ago was born the first Airstream trailer. And with it was born yet another dream, a dream of new freedom, new places, new experiences, and new friendships. It was a dream so powerful, so enduring it did far more than create a new way of travel; it created a new way of life shared by thousands upon thousands of families.<br/><br/>The Airstream philosophy has always been and will always be, ? Let?s not make any changes ? let?s make only improvements!? Every inch of an Airstream has a functional purpose. There is no planned obsolescence. This is as true of the 2003 models as it was of the first Airstream to see the light of the open road. The classic Airstream of the thirties is no museum piece. Still in use today, it is as sturdy and modern in appearance as the first day it swung into traffic. As a result, an Airstream is always ?in style? ? conceived and constructed as a lifetime investment in happiness. <br/><br/>Today, the 2003 Airstream is the most thoroughly tested Airstream in trailer history. It is years ahead in engineering ? the culmination of over 70 years of experience in trailer making, millions of miles of Caravan travel throughout the world; plus millions of miles more, run up by happy Airstream owners! More than ever, the 2003 Airstream remains a testimonial to the practical vision, the tenacity and know-how of one dedicated man ?

Sid says the product has an earthy, sweet flavor and a texture similar to that of Parmesan. <br/><br/>Many of Carr Valley?s specialty cheeses are sold to upscale restaurants in Chicago and specialty food stores nationwide with help of a California distributor. Not to fear, Sid?s cheeses can also be found at the plant?s Wisconsin locations.<br/><br/>Sid relates creating a new cheese to cooking. ?You think about what you want to achieve, assess the variables and start mixing.? The cultures, species of milk, coagulants, other ingredients, cook temperatures, how you handle it, whether it?s pressed or allowed to rest, actual curing, temperature, bacteria ? all provide Sid with the opportunity to alter the flavor. ?If you don?t like the cheese a certain way, you can change it,? he says matter of factly.<br/><br/>But he contends that Wisconsin is the place for making specialty cheeses. ?We have the right forages here in Wisconsin for making good cheeses. We can do what other states can?t, as you can?t make the same flavor profiles elsewhere,? Sid explains. He continues by explaining that the weather, soils, forages and use of clover all make a difference in the milk flavor.<br/><br/>Sid?s isn?t the only one interested in specialty cheeses. According to the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board there are more specialty cheeses than ever. More than 11 percent, or 234 million pounds, of the total cheeses produced in Wisconsin during 2001 were classified as ?specialty.? According to the Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics Service, 2001?s production is an increase of 6 percent from the previous year.<br/><br/>Cheesemaking has been a way of life for this fourth-generation cheesemaker. ?From the time I was real little I can remember being in the plant. My first job was to pick up can lids and keep the cans moving...I remember standing on a 5-gallon pail to stir the corners of the vats and even riding my tricycle around the vats,? Sid reminisces.<br/><br/>He continued working at the plant, earning this cheesemaker?s license at 16. After graduating from UW-Platteville, Sid planned to attend law school but wasn?t accepted on his first try. It was then that destiny intervened; Sid spent the year adjusting to married life and working as a cheesemaker. ? I liked it; I liked the life and what I was doing. I saw a lot of opportunity in the business,? Sid says.<br/><br/>Tulane University invited him to join its law program the following fall but Sid decided to pursue a career closer to home in the cheese business, and says he has never regretted the decision. It even appears that Sid?s son, Sam, may continue in the family business. A recent high school graduate, Sam has his cheesemaker?s license and has taken courses at UW-Madison to improve his technique. <br/><br/>It remains that old-fashioned cheddar made the family way is still one of Sid?s favorites. Why cheddar? ?Because you can enjoy the fresh, squeaky curds all the way through to the 5-year-old mature cheeses,? Sid says.<br/><br/>Carr Valley?s 23-pound daisy wheels are nationally known for their quality ? a quality that starts with milk produced by ?cows with names,? says Sid. Milk for the plant comes from local dairy producers, of which some have been shipping to the plant for 20 to 30 years.<br/><br/>Before entering the plant, the milk is pasteurized and filtered. Once in the cheese vat, the milk is held at 90 degrees. As the vat fills with milk a culture is added that produces a lactic acid to ripen the fresh milk. This begins turning the milk into cheese. <br/><br/>During these first steps, the cheesemakers add coloring to some cheese styles, Cheddar being one. <br/><br/>Once the milk has ripened, an enzyme is added to coagulate the milk. The coagulant turns the liquid milk into a jelly-like substance, aided by no longer stirring the product. After the cheese firms, large wire cutters are pushed by cheesemakers to cut the vat into thirds. At this time, the vat temperature is raised to 100 degrees to ?cook? the cheese for 30 minutes. ?Cooking? separates the curds from the whey. Some whey is drawn off the vat and goes to a cream separator before being stored. The cream is used in cream/whey butter. The separated whey ingredient is used in making breads and candy bars.<br/><br/>The curd firms as the whey is drained. The curd is hand cut into slabs which are then stacked and pressed together in a process known as ?cheddaring.? This helps the excess moisture drain and prepares the product for its transformation to cheese.<br/><br/>Once at the proper acidic level, approximately 60 minutes later, the slabs are milled ? shredding the large blocks into bit-sized morsels. Then the curds are salted to preserve the cheese and slow the active cheese culture.<br/><br/>Curds are then formed into 23-pound daisy wheels. These wheels are pressed for thwo to three hours before removing the form. The golden wheels are dried before being coated with wax. <br/><br/>The wax coating seals the cheese from air and mold. The finished wheels are then aged for as little as one week all the way to five years.<br/><br/>Sid produces Fontina and cheddar, both of which he is certified as a master cheesemaker, along with specialty products such as Canaria, Menage, Benedicine, Mobay and Marisa, named for his daughter.<br/><br/>At the La Valle plant, cheddar is made six days a week; the plant is closed on Sundays, Christmas Day and New Year?s Day. Besides the large selection of cheeses, the La Valle location offers plenty of free samples, and a conglomeration of Wisconsin products such as wild rice, ginseng, syrups, honey and pancake mix. The quaint store even includes viewing windows, with 8 a.m.-noon being the best time to observe the cheesemaking process. </div> "}, "id": "82SR0I2GEJN1ZBNN"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/leinenkugel-brewing", "City": "Test", "Name": "Leinenkugel Brewing", "Longitude": -91.395883, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 44.942766, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " When Jacob Leinenkugel first came to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1866, he found wide rivers, lush forests, clean water. And 2500 thirsty lumberjacks. As the son of a German brew master and brother to two others, Jacob knew an opportunity when he saw one. So he and business partner John Miller set to work building the Spring Brewery. The name held the secret of their rich, tasty product. The pure water that flowed from the Big Eddy Spring. Neither acidic nor alkaline, the water was perfect for brewing full-bodied beer. And, in 1867, the first batch of Leinenkugel's beer was born.<br/><br/>Within thirteen years, Jacob and his crew were handcrafting 1800 barrels of Leinie's per year to meet the growing thirst for quality beer in the Chippewa Valley. By 1890 he had expanded the renamed Jacob Leinenkugel's Spring Brewery to include a new brew house, three-story malt house and a barn to house the teams of horses that drew the Leinie's delivery wagons. After Jacob's death in 1899, son Matt stepped in as the second-generation Leinenkugel to oversee the precious family heritage that is Leinenkugel's beer.<br/><br/>Since then, Leinie's has grown from one variety to seven and has won loyal fans throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, and even Arizona. But the important things remain unchanged. Our love for the Northwoods and our dedication to handcrafting the finest beers from the finest ingredients.

The Pacific Group exports products throughout Asia, Europe and the Middle East and also imports products from many of these areas as well. <br/><br/>The Pacific Seafood Group began in 1941 by Frank M. Dulcich and his son Dominic Dulcich in Portland, Oregon, beginning from small retail counter and servicing discriminating customers at this same counter until this day. The business expanded to meet local distribution demands and as they say the rest is history. Beginning in 1977 an import department was established to meet local and extended customer needs. The distribution business continued to flourish over those years and brought the need for a consistent supply of high quality locally processed seafood that Pacific would develop by understanding their customer's needs. <br/><br/>In 1983 the Pacific Seafood Group expanded to processing with the purchase of our first plant in Warrenton, Oregon, Pacific Coast Seafood. The plant is located on the mouth of the majestic Columbia River, one of the most active fishing ports on the west coast. Processing of Dungeness Crab, Cold Water Shrimp, Groundfish and Salmon assisted tremendously to meet our customer's needs. <br/><br/>Since 1983 the Pacific Seafood Group has expanded all areas of their business with a strategy to grow distribution and to increase processing capabilities to meet the demands of not only our growing distribution customer base, but also meet the needs of our growing customer base throughout the US and the world.<br/> <br/>Being the largest has never been the goal of the Pacific Seafood Group, but being the best is our goal. Operational Excellence is our business model to meet customer needs with top quality products and hassle free service. The expansion of distribution has always been coordinated with primary processing expansions to assure that our market base is guaranteed to meet growing customer demands with high quality products.<br/><br/>The expansion of Pacific has been swift over the past decade as new markets and processing facilities have opened up.

May they bring you as much enjoyment as they have me.<br/><br/>Virginia Turner has spent her life in joyful company. Twenty years in doll making as given her many reasons to celebrate. Her merry family of dolls has also introduced her to many wonderful friends and exciting experiences, and has led her to her destiny. <br/>A former bank employee, Virginia's career in doll making began in 1981 with Virginia's Very Own, a line of reproduction porcelain dolls. \"My career in dolls began in the basement of our home in North Vernon' Indiana,\" Virginia explains. \"My husband's sister, Judy, had sculpted a doll that a doll company in New York wanted to market. Since they were a vinyl operation, the company asked if Judy would provide them with the doll and they would make the clothing. Judy asked my husband, Boyce, and me if we would make the porcelain arms and legs and attach them to the body.\" <br/><br/>Boyce, who had managed a porch swing factory for 25 years, and Virginia began producing porcelain in the basement of their home while Judy sculpted the dolls' heads. Virginia also learned to paint china. Soon, Virginia, Boyce and Judy decided to start manufacturing their own dolls. Turner Dolls began with three reproductions by Virginia and three of Judy's sculpts. <br/><br/>In 1989, Virginia began creating her own original porcelain dolls after a sculpting seminar helped her to take responsibility for her own destiny. Lewis Goldstein, a sculptor and teacher, held a sculpting seminar at the Turner Dolls studio for Virginia and a group of her friends. Lewis encouraged Virginia to continue sculpting. \"I had sculpted a small head,\" she says, \"that I thought was not very good. Lewis told me that I had potential. I remember him saying that I wasn't ready for a Doll Reader ad, and that you crawl before you walk, and to keep sculpting.\" <br/><br/>Virginia did continue to sculpt, and finally called upon divine inspiration to seal her fate. \"One Sunday afternoon I was wondering if I was really meant to stay in the doll business,\" she explains. \"After a quiet time in prayer asking for guidance, I decided to sculpt another head. The result was a smiling toddler with two teeth. When I showed the sculpt to Boyce, his comment was, ~ow that's worth making a mold.' He made the mold, and we offered her in either pink or blue, with brown or blue eyes and blonde, red or brown hair.\" That doll was Jeannie, Virginia's first original porcelain doll. <br/><br/>In 1991, with vinyl dolls gaining in popularity, Virginia created Kitty Kay, her own vinyl doll. The vinyl parts were molded for the Turners by another company. Due to Kitty Kay's success, the Turners installed their own vinyl ovens in their studio. Haley was the first vinyl doll to be produced in the Turner Dolls studio. <br/><br/>In 1986, Virginia and Boyce had moved from North Vernon to a 40-acre farm in Heltonville, Indiana, where they had begun to manufacture their dolls. \"My in-laws deeded the farm over to us,\" says Virginia, \"and we began to remodel the house and build the Turner Doll Studio on the front acreage.\" The house, built in 1848, originally belonged to Boyce's grandfather and was willed to Boyce's father, Ralph Turner. \"There are two good-sized ponds on the back side that are stocked with fish,\" says Virginia. \"The fields are in pasture for our cattle and sheep. We have our own chickens, geese and swans, and also, not to be forgotten, two little jackasses. Yep, that's the correct name for them! <br/><br/>\"The studio that I sculpt in was once the woodhouse/smokehouse,\" continues Virginia. \"Underneath my studio is the cellar, which is still being used today for potatoes, etc., that are raised in the garden. I have a little deck on the side of my studio that I can sculpt on in the summer that overlooks one of the ponds. Our farm is joined to the 90-acre farm of Boyce's parents, and our cattle graze their fields, too. It is a very peaceful way of life on the back side of the house, and a very busy, commercial way of life on the front toward the road.\" <br/><br/>The very busy, commercial way of life Virginia describes is no exaggeration. Turner Dolls makes approximately 15~000 dolls a year, with Virginia designing most of the clothing for the dolls. \"The ideas for my dolls come from many different directions,\" says Virginia. \"Sometimes a picture inspires me. A lot of times, fabrics inspire the doll. A beautiful fabric can make a vision come into my head quickly.\" The insights and support of others in the doll business also inspires Virginia. She explains, \"A program director from the Hamilton Collection said to me, 'Remember, no matter how many times something has been done, when you do your version, it's new.' So, I keep that in mind. I also listen to the public as they talk to me while viewing my dolls. My daughters, Julie, Susan and Teri, are good critics and my employees are really very supportive and inspiring.\" <br/><br/>The process Virginia goes through when making a doll begins with deciding which category of doll needs a new sculpt. \"We have several different sizes and ages of dolls,\" she explains. Virginia begins to sculpt with plastic clay that does not dry out with an armature supporting the clay. Next, Boyce makes a plaster of paris mold of the sculpt that will allow the Turners to pour the doll in porcelain. <br/><br/>\"When we get the porcelain pieces done,\" she says, \"we must decide if we think the doll will adapt to vinyl well. If so, then we send the porcelain head to a wax artist who makes a rubber mold of the porcelain head. He casts the head in wax so that it can then be sent to the metal mold maker who makes our metal molds we use in our rotational ovens to make the vinyl dolls.\" <br/><br/>Virginia's 2001 collection echoes the beautiful words of William Wordsworth. The dolls Virginia has created are a gleeful band of children in a colorful array of costumes that are destined to bring joy to anyone who sees them. \"Sometimes I feel that I can't do anything different or better,\" she explains, \"but each year I come up with a new group of faces that become almost like my family. It keeps growing each year, and I can truly say they become real personalities to me.\" Two of Virginia's favorites from the 2001 collection are \"Tanzie, a happy baby in a dress that I feel makes Tanzie smile,\" says Virginia, \"and Dina, Born to Shop because I like to shop and because I also wouldn't mind having a coat and hat like Dina's myself! \" <br/><br/>Fairy-tale characters also appear in the 2001 collection. Virginia has created Red Riding Hood, a 24-inch vinyl doll wearing a multi-print dress with a red, velvet hooded cape. Her basket contains a checked cloth and a loaf of salt dough bread. Red Riding Hood is limited to 200. Cinderella is a 24-inch doll that is also limited to 200. Her blue-and-cream charmeuse dress is accented with an overlay of sparkle and ivory venice, which is embroidered with sequins and pearls. <br/><br/>In addition, Virginia has created Mona, Cherie, Barry and Celadon, four adorable children. Mona, a 32-inch standing, vinyl girl dressed for a tea party, has auburn hair and green eyes. She is limited to 400. Siblings Cherie and Barry are each limited to 500. Cherie, a 30-inch vinyl little girl, comes with Cherry Beary, her favorite white bear. Her brother, Barry, carries a friendly green bear. And Celadon, a 33-inch vinyl doll, also comes with a bear. The doll wears a celadon green dupioni silk dress and an ivory wool pillbox hat. She is limited to 450. <br/><br/>An adventure from Virginia's life has also inspired one of the dolls in the 2001 collection. \"One of the most outstanding highlights of my career in dolls,\" she explains, \"was a trip to France in 1992 when I went for a two-week long sculpting class from Martine Vogel. Martine was a master sculptor. I wasn't familiar with the professional sculpting artists, only doll artists. Sculpting for the purpose of having the sculpt put into bronze or some other medium was a different story. For Martine's class, she had us first sculpt the skull and then finish the head, using the model's profile more than the front features. I learned from the class the benefit of having a live model. I think that Martine helped me to achieve a more realistic look to my dolls rather than a 'dolly' look. I'm still working on that and probably always will be. <br/><br/>\"After the class was over,\" Virginia continues, \"we toured France for 10 days. One of our most memorable stops was the town of Limoges. The town is noted for the porcelain factories there. While there, I purchased several pieces of popular cobalt blue decorated in gold. So, this year, my new sculpt for my large girl will be the Girl From Limoges. She will be holding a cobalt blue-and- gold Limoges lidded box with Turner Dolls 2001 printed in gold on the inside bottom of the box.\" Turner Dolls will create 20 dolls of the Girl From Limoges in porcelain and 280 in vinyl. While Turner Dolls are made in Caucasian skin tones, they can also be made in olive skin tones for Hispanic and Asian dolls and African-American skin tones. <br/><br/>In addition, Virginia has added a new doll to her Metropolitan Moments series that she created for the Ashton-Drake Galleries. The series, which began with Deirdre, a little girl in a pink coat carrying a carpet bag, will end with Alexandra, an ice skater in a light blue, velvet coat. Virginia has also made two dolls for Seymour Mann. \"I really stay busy,\" she says, \"because I sculpt the dolls, design the clothes, help Boyce with the photography, stay very much in touch with the factory production and do about seven signings and at least three trade shows.\" <br/><br/>Virginia's busy schedule allows her to come into contact with many of the collectors who enjoy her dolls. The feedback she receives from collectors has revealed to Virginia that they are drawn to her dolls because of the emotions the dolls inspire. \"The collectors tell me, 'Your dolls make me feel happy,\"I love the clothes you put them in,' or 'They remind me of real children.' I've always said that when a collector goes toward a certain doll, it's similar to being drawn to a special melody or a picture or a piece of art. It touches a place that says this makes me feel good. I would enjoy having this around me for enjoyment.\" <br/><br/>Collectors and others in the doll business also have helped to make Virginia's 22-year tenure enjoyable. \"I think there are so many things that are exciting in being a doll artist,\" she says. ',I love getting the new dolls together each year for the American International Toy Fair(r). Toy Fair is by far more exciting for me than Christmas was when I was a child. I have been able to travel all over the United States and have met so many wonderful people that there are no words to express how I feel. I have enjoyed all my friends who are also doll artists and owners of doll companies. Although we are basically in competition, we are always ready to help each other. Some of my dearest friends are my friends who, like me, are making their living making dolls. <br/><br/>\"Now that I start my 22nd year in dolls,\" Virginia continues, \"I will also be starting my 66th year of my life. I feel that I could easily be happy doing this for another 20 years. I just hope God gives me the chance. It's a great profession for this lady!\" </div> "}, "id": "99MAUVOAC80OIEQC"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/tennessee/rhyne-clock-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Rhyne Clock Company", "Longitude": -83.196191, "State/Province": "Tennessee", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.969279, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Misc", "Description": " Rhyne Clock Company has become a tourism attraction in Cocke County.

When a customer purchases a Longaberger basket, they also are sharing in the Longaberger story and family tradition. The Company?s mission statement ? ?To Stimulate A Better Quality Of Life? ? reflects Longaberger?s commitment to the Company?s founding philosophy that people are the key to our success. We are a family-owned Company with a family-friendly environment. <br/><br/>The Longaberger History<br/>In 1896, when the Longaberger family moved to Dresden, Ohio, the tiny village still enjoyed its prosperity as a rural transportation and industrial hub in the rolling foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. There was a hotel on Main Street, three railroad stations, a woolen mill and a paper mill. In the not-too-distant past, a side-cut canal had connected the community with the historic Ohio Canal, transforming the village into a bustling canal town.<br/><br/>In the early 1900s, baskets were as commonplace as paper bags and plastic containers are now. Ware Baskets, made at the Dresden Basket Factory, were used to carry pottery ware for the region's booming pottery industry. <br/><br/>In 1919, J.W. Longaberger (Dave?s father) took a job with the Dresden Basket Factory. As a full-time apprentice he meticulously learned the basketmaking art by first crafting basket bottoms. Later he mastered the precise, tight weaving style that would become his trademark. J.W. grew to love the art of basketry.<br/><br/>While working at the basket factory, J.W. met Bonnie Jean Gist from the neighboring community of Trinway. Their courtship led to marriage in 1927. During the Great Depression, the Dresden Basket Factory closed. J.W. found work at the local paper mill, but continued making baskets after work and on weekends. In 1936, J.W. and Bonnie purchased the closed Dresden Basket Factory and the home on that property. J.W. then named his new business The Ohio Ware Basket Company, reflecting the importance of Ware Baskets and the pottery industry to his small side business. <br/><br/>The Longaberger family eventually grew to include 12 children ? six boys and six girls. Bonnie worked full time at the woolen mill to help make ends meet and the older children helped their father by making basket bottoms, carefully arranging the up-splints for pottery Ware Baskets and even selling baskets to the neighbors. <br/><br/>In 1934, a fifth child was born to J.W. and Bonnie ? Dave Longaberger. Early in life, Dave had three strikes against him. His family was economically disadvantaged, he stuttered so badly people had difficulty understanding him, and he had epilepsy in a time when the condition was not widely understood.<br/><br/>Dave's liabilities did not stand in the way of his ambition, however. As a youngster he worked in a grocery store, shoveled snow, delivered papers, mowed grass and hauled trash. He ran the projectors at the local movie house. Because Dave was always making money from one job or another, his family called him the \"25-cent millionaire.\" <br/><br/>At age 21, Dave finally graduated from high school. He began his career by driving a bread truck for several years for two different bakeries. From 1961-62, Dave served in the U.S. Army. <br/><br/>In the early 60s, his first daughter Tami was born, and Dave grew anxious to take the many lessons he had learned over the years to work for his own business and family. In 1963, when Harry's Dairy Bar in Dresden came up for sale, Dave and his wife bought it. The restaurant had two booths, two tables and eight stools. Later Dave also purchased the defunct A&amp;P Grocery in town, remodeled and expanded the building, and opened the Dresden IGA Foodliner. As always, Dave worked very hard during those years, and between both businesses he earned a solid living for his family, which now also included younger daughter Rachel.<br/><br/>In the early 1970s, Dave noticed that baskets were becoming very popular, and he also noticed that many department stores were beginning to sell imported baskets. Dave wondered if people would appreciate baskets like the fine handcrafted ones his father used to make. He asked his father to make a dozen market baskets, and then took them to a nearby town. They sold immediately and the shop requested more! J.W. made several dozen more baskets. Sadly, however, J.W. died at the age of 71, just as the family trade was being renewed. <br/><br/>Dave opened J.W.'s Handwoven Baskets? in 1976 in Dresden. Interest in these beautiful handmade baskets continued to grow, until Dave had to find a place in which to expand his small basket factory. He found a very unlikely building: the old woolen mill where his mother had worked, built in the 1890s. It had stood vacant since 1955, and had broken windows, uneven floors and a sagging roof. The brick walls were all that remained solid and strong of the facility. In this dilapidated building, Dave envisioned a basket factory with hundreds of craftsmen and craftswomen weaving, tacking, talking and laughing. He had proven to himself from his previous business ventures that he had a knack for envisioning the unlikely, so he approached his new venture with great enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Dave became increasingly convinced that American consumers wanted the handmade craftsmanship and quality of Longaberger baskets. He tried different ways to sell baskets at malls, department stores and other retails outlets, with varying degrees of success. In 1978, Dave discovered that the most effective way to sell the company?s baskets was not through retail outlets but through home shows, where an educated basket associate could show Longaberger baskets and share the history and explain the craftsmanship that each basket holds. The Longaberger Company?s direct sales organization was born.<br/><br/>In 1984, Dave?s daughter Tami joined the Company full-time after her graduation from The Ohio State University. Tami worked in virtually every area of the company, and in 1994 Dave appointed her president. Working side by side until Dave's death in 1999, Tami learned her father?s management principles first-hand. Clearly cut from the same visionary cloth as her father, she used her own extraordinary gifts to diversify the company into other home lifestyle areas, which now account for nearly half of the company?s revenues.<br/><br/>Under Tami?s leadership, collectors have developed a passion for baskets and the Company has experienced consistent annual growth. The Company has been featured for its cutting edge employee programs and outstanding corporate citizenship. Dave?s younger daughter Rachel carries on the family?s tradition of philanthropy by heading The Longaberger Foundation, which has donated millions to local charities and educational institutions since its inception in 1998.<br/><br/>Today, The Longaberger Company is the premier maker of handmade baskets in the United States, employing nearly 7,000 craftsmen and craftswomen as well as professional support staff and 70,000 Independent Sales Associates. Under the direction of CEO and President Tami Longaberger, the Company has grown to a $1 billion organization and diversified into product lines including wrought iron, pottery and fabric accessories. The Longaberger name is synonymous with quality; our baskets are handmade to be handed down and home accessory items add pleasure and functionality to the home.<br/><br/>Longaberger is one of Forbes magazine's top privately held companies. The Company was recognized as the 18th largest woman ? owned company in the U.S. by Working Woman magazine and has been cited by Newman?s Own, Inc. and George magazine as one of the Top 10 Most Generous Companies in America.<br/> <br/>Longaberger travel destinations include our basket-shaped Home Office, our manufacturing tour and Longaberger Homestead, our shopping, dining and entertainment complex.<br/><br/>Basketmakng Tour ?

But the founding of Mrs Baird's Bread wasn't exactly a smooth road.<br/><br/>In 1901 William and Ninnie Baird brought their family from Tennessee to Fort Worth, Texas. William, a restaurateur by trade, set up a business in downtown Fort Worth selling popcorn from a bright red cart with brass fittings and a loud steam whistle. Within months his success led him to buy another popcorn cart which was run by his oldest son, Dewey, only eight-years-old. But it wasn't long before William Baird decided to get back into the restaurant business.<br/><br/>By 1905, William Baird had started, built up and sold one restaurant and was working on his second, when he received devastating news. He was diagnosed as having diabetes, in those days an incurable and untreatable disease.<br/><br/>Although very ill, William Baird and his young son Dewey worked in the family restaurant. Ninnie Baird tended to the home and her three other sons, and like everyone else of that time, she baked for her family.<br/><br/>Every day she would cut wood to fire the wood-burning stove. It was hot, sometimes dirty work, but in spite of the lack of modern conveniences, Mrs. Baird became a wonderful baker. The loaves of bread, cakes and pies she baked, the family enjoyed. Any extra was shared with the neighbors. Her bread was so delicious that it wasn't long before her reputation was known far and wide.<br/><br/>Ninnie did all her baking in a wood-fired stove...<br/><br/>In 1908, with William's health failing, it became impossible for him to continue working. It was clear that Ninnie Baird needed to find a way to help support her family, so she established Mrs Baird's Bread.<br/><br/>In 1911, William died and Ninnie Baird decided to continue the business she had begun. Every day, in her home, in a wood-burning stove that could bake only four loaves at a time, Ninnie baked her wonderful bread, cakes and pies. Her boys helped bake and deliver the bread on foot. Her daughters took care of the smaller children and did other chores around the house. Mrs Baird's Bread was truly a family business.<br/><br/>As business grew, the boys went from delivering bread on foot, to riding bicycles.<br/><br/>In 1915, demand for Mrs Baird's bread had outgrown Ninnie's wood-burning stove. A larger oven was needed so she bought a commercial oven from the Metropolitan Hotel in Fort Worth. Unable to pay cash for the $75 oven, Ninnie put down $25 and paid out the rest in bread and rolls. The new oven, which could bake 40 loaves at a time, was installed in a small wooden building in the family's backyard.<br/><br/>Sales continued to grow to the point where the boys could not make deliveries on their bicycles. So, the Baird's buggy was converted into a wagon and pulled by the family horse, Ned. The first company employee, Mr. Lipps, who was not a Baird family member, was hired to drive the wagon.<br/><br/>Ned, it turns out, was quite a delivery horse. He came to know the route so well that he would stop at every customer's house without the urging of his driver. Over time, delivering to the sales route became son Hoyt's job. In 1917 the family bought a Ford passenger car, took out the seats and painted \"Eat More Mrs Baird's Bread\" on the sides.<br/><br/>Old Ned retires and expansion begins...<br/><br/>About this time Mrs Baird's Bread began selling to commercial accounts. Two Telephone Exchanges bought pies daily and Sandegard's Grocery became the company's first bread reseller. Sandegard's, a large store with a delicatessen, proved to be a very good customer as it soon grew to 15 stores, all displaying Mrs Baird's Bread prominently in a glass case.<br/><br/>In 1918, Hoyt Baird left Fort Worth to join the Army, leaving the company without a delivery driver. It was decided to discontinue selling direct and concentrate instead on selling only wholesale. Demand steadily increased, and so did the bakery. Now located at 6th Avenue and Terrell Street, the little 30 foot by 72 foot facility housed an oven that could bake 400 loaves at a time. Wholesale deliveries now stretched into every corner of Fort Worth, where fresh-baked bread, rolls, cakes and pies were delivered every day. Over the next ten years the bakery was enlarged nine times, until it was one of the largest baking facilities in Texas.<br/><br/>In 1928, the Bairds opened a new bakery across the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The stock market crash of 1929 signaled the start of the Great Depression, and, like everyone else, Mrs Baird's Bread had to cut back to survive those lean times. By 1938, business was returning to normal and the bakery needed to expand again. They built a new bakery in Houston, Texas and added another plant in Fort Worth. Once a one-horse delivery system, now a fleet of trucks was needed at each of the four bakeries. The two new bakeries also featured plate glass windows so that visitors could watch the baking process. Not only could you smell the delicious bread, but you could watch it being made as well.<br/><br/>In the 1940's, America entered World War II and the country saw a shortage of many items, like sugar. Because they went off to fight the war, workers were also in short supply. These shortages forced Mrs Baird's to reduce the number and kinds of bread product it baked, but it never compromised on quality. If an ingredient was in short supply, then the bakery just didn't bake that item for a while.<br/><br/>Post War Growth establishes Mrs Baird's as Texas' Bread<br/><br/>Following the war, in 1949, Mrs Baird's expanded again building a bakery in Abilene, Texas. In 1959 and 1960 the company acquired bakeries in the Texas cities of Victoria, Lubbock, Waco and Austin.<br/><br/>Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, the company prospered. Ninnie Baird, the namesake of the thriving company, however, experienced declining health. Now 80, she stayed at home most of the time. The boys handled most of the day-to-day operations, but Ninnie Baird, still the Chairman of the Board, was always consulted on the major decisions. The family's commitment to quality, freshness and service never waivered. It was a work ethic that was passed on from generation to generation as well as, the importance of family, a Christian upbringing, and community. From the beginning until her death, she shared with her neighbors and her community.<br/><br/>Tour one of Mrs Baird's Bakeries and see firsthand how Mrs Baird's Bread is baked.

Yet for Thomas Kay, a young English weaver, it was a dream come true. An old hand at sea voyages, he had already crossed the Atlantic years earlier to work at east coast textile mills. With skills honed, he was now headed to an area with ideal conditions for growing sheep and producing wool. A place with moderate weather and plentiful water - America's newest state, Oregon. <br/><br/>Kay helped organize Oregon's second woolen mill in Brownsville, where he oversaw the weaving operation. Soon he was made a superintendent of the company. In 1889, Thomas Kay opened his own mill in Salem, Oregon. From these humble beginnings rose a dyed-in-the-wool American success story. <br/><br/>Thomas Kay's eldest daughter, Fannie, learned the mill business and ably assisted her father in mill operation and management. When she married retail merchant C.P. Bishop, a complementary combination of merchandising and manufacturing expertise emerged - a solid foundation for what was to become Pendleton Woolen Mills. <br/><br/>This dual textile-retail heritage was passed on to the three Bishop sons, Clarence, Roy and Chauncy. In 1909, with family and town backing, the Bishop sons purchased an idle mill in Pendleton, Oregon. <br/><br/>A major railhead serving the Columbia Plateau, the town of Pendleton was a wool shipping center for sheep growers of the region. The mill, originally built in 1893, began as a wool scouring plant, which washed the raw wool before shipping. Due to increased freight tariffs on the shipment of scoured wool, the business soon became unprofitable. <br/><br/>In 1895, the scouring plant was enlarged and converted into a woolen mill which made bed blankets and robes for Native Americans. This venture also failed and the mill went idle. Upon purchasing the mill in 1909, the Bishops constructed a new, more efficient mill building with aid of a local bond issue. In September of that year, the first products emerged from the new finishing department and the tradition of Pendleton Woolen Mills began. <br/><br/>The production of Indian blankets resumed as the Bishops applied intuitive business concepts for quality products and distinctive styling. A study of the color and design preferences of local and Southwest Native Americans resulted in vivid colors and intricate patterns. Trade expanded from the Nez Perce nation near Pendleton to the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni nations. These Pendleton blankets were used as basic wearing apparel and as a standard of value for trading and credit among Native Americans. The blankets also became prized for ceremonial use. Under the direction of its new owners, Pendleton expanded into other areas of woolen manufacturing. In 1912, the addition of a weaving mill in Washougal, Washington, broadened its capability for fabric variety, including suitings. <br/><br/>Wool shirts for men were largely utility items in the early 20th century. Drab in design and color, they were worn for warmth and protection from the elements by those who worked outdoors. Clarence Morton (C.M.) Bishop had a vision for wool shirts in vivid colors and intricate patterns. The production of woolen shirting material was a natural extension of the mill's capabilities. In 1924, the legendary Pendleton virgin wool men's shirt was born. By 1929, Pendleton was making a full line of men's virgin wool sportswear. <br/><br/>The untimely death of his brother, Chauncy, in 1927 left C.M. Bishop with full responsibility for the management of Pendleton Woolen Mills. Roy Bishop had moved on to own and manage the Oregon Worsted Company in 1918. With his parent's support, Clarence was now the guiding force of this growing enterprise. <br/><br/>A new thread was woven into the Pendleton corporate cloth in 1949 - womenswear manufacturing. Market research identified a need and an opportunity for branded virgin wool classic sportswear for women. Nevertheless, no one could have predicted the enormous success of a single garment introduced with the Pendleton womenswear line that year. The 49er jacket gained instant popularity. Its simple, casual styling and intrinsic value were a perfect match for the emerging suburban lifestyle of postwar America. As the apparel division thrived, Pendleton responded to a consumer need for non-wool garments to compliment its fine woolen coordinated within the fall and winter lines.Yet brand loyal customers wanted the same classic Pendleton look for all seasons. In 1972, Pendleton became a year-around sportswear resource, introducing distinctively styled, non-wool menswear and womenswear for spring and summer wear. <br/><br/>Historically, Pendleton products were distributed through selected traditional department and specialty stores. The 1980's saw Pendleton apply its considerable retail experience to building a retail division that encompassed both company and privately owned specialty stores. These stores offered consumers a full selection of Pendleton products and provided greater access to Pendleton products across the country. The thread had now come full circle, for this direct involvement in the retail sector harkened back to C.P. Bishop's original clothing store in Salem, Oregon. <br/><br/>Pendleton has thrived under the direction of the Bishop family. Today the company owns and operates 14 facilities that encompass all aspects of its operation. For many years, Clarence's sons, C.M. Bishop, Jr. (Mort) and Broughton (Brot) Bishop, acted as co-executive officers, and both continue to participate in company management. Brot is now Chairman and CEO and Mort is Vice-Chairman. <br/><br/>Today, their sons have assumed administrative roles in the company. C.M. Bishop III is president while John and Charles are both involved in mill and financial management. Another son, Peter, is involved in the Catalog/Internet Division. This family thread continues to produce Pendleton leadership with a legacy of hands-on management. </div> "}, "id": "B9XY3LN2U0ACU1G5"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/tennessee/duroboat", "City": "Test", "Name": "Duroboat", "Longitude": -88.41011, "State/Province": "Tennessee", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.94255, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Duroboat is a small aluminum boat manufacturing company located in Huntington, TN, convenient to travelers along I-40 or US Highway 70, Broadway of America. <br/><br/>Duroboat manufactures small high performance aluminum boats that are unique because of a patented process that does not require welds or rivets.

Blaisdell obtained the rights for an Austrian windproof lighter with a removable top, and re-designed it to his own specifications.

From the very beginning he backed the Zippo lighter with a lifetime guarantee that ?it works or we fix it freeTM?.<br/><br/>TODAY<br/>Zippo has produced over 450 million windproof lighters since its founding in 1932.

Alfred had studied cheese-making not only in Europe but also in Africa.<br/><br/>Although he originally targeted Austria as the location for his own cheese-making enterprise, a neighbor in Switzerland mentioned Ohio?s need for skilled cheese-makers. He emigrated a year before the rest of his family, all of whom eventually became involved in the business.<br/><br/>His wife, Margaret, whose dream was to operate a \"little shop\" has been fully realized with the Chalet in the Valley portion of the Guggisberg complex. Alfred has passed away, but Margaret is still active in company business.<br/><br/>Son Eric runs the Swiss Inn, and his brother Richard is in charge of the two factories, the newer of which is located in Sugarcreek.<br/><br/>The entire complex began with nothing more than large copper kettles?which could produce up to a 200-pound block of cheese a day?and old world family ingenuity, perseverance, and tradition. As the area grew, so did the Guggisberg cheese factory. By 1967, the family had created its current signature item, Baby Swiss.<br/><br/>Over the years, customers have come to crave the ?mild, creamy? flavor of Baby Swiss, so named by Magaret Guggisberg because she thought it looked like the small offspring of the original Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>The cheese-making process at Guggisberg begins early in the morning with the purchase of milk, primarily from farmers in Wayne and Holmes County who maintain comparatively small herds.<br/><br/>Pasteurized milk is then pumped into three stainless steel vats and held for three to four hours. It goes through several different stages during which curds and whey (the watery portion of the milk) are separated. Whey is stored for use in other products. Curds, the component used for cheese, are pressed down with heavy lids that press out as much of the whey as possible and flatten the cheese into wheel molds.<br/><br/>After the cheese is packaged, it must be moved to warming cellars. It is this portion of the process through which it gains its flavor and its holes. Each package is dated and tracked with weight and type noted to assure the proper length of time needed to allow trapped carbon dioxide to release and ?pop the holes.?<br/><br/>The ingredients that make each cheese slightly different are the cultures and enzymes that are added to the vats and that ?go to work in the warming cellar.?<br/><br/>The flavor of cheese is even affected by the time of the year in which the milk is produced and by what the cows are eating.<br/><br/>Fat and protein content are also adjusted for different types of cheese. In general, fattier cheeses are creamier.<br/><br/>When the cheese is aged and ready, Guggisberg sells it wholesale, retail, and through mail order distribution in Ohio and the Pittsburgh area, although we are starting to spread out a bit.<br/><br/>Cheese can continue to age slowly, even once it has reached its peak, in a cold cellar for up to two years; a period of six months produces a sharper flavor. Left outside of refrigeration to ?puff out,? as some customers like it to do, is safe because a vacuum-packed seal assures it will not mold.<br/><br/>The Guggisberg Cheese Factory was founded by a Swiss cheesemaker and is now Swiss family owned and operated. Nestled in the hills of Doughty Valley and surrounded by flowers, Guggisberg Cheese is home to the Original Baby Swiss.

When he filed his first mining claim in 1877 he named it \"Tombstone,\" because he'd been told that his tombstone was all that he would find in the parched, Apache-ruled hills of southeast Arizona. A year later, when he filed his second claim, he named it \"Good Enough\" because the silver ore was so rich that it was good enough to satisfy him.<br/><br/>Thousands of fortune-seekers followed Schieffelin, hoping to duplicate his success, opening dozens of other mines (Ed, alone, had 19). Above ground, the boomtown of Tombstone was born and flourished. But silver prices eventually fell, the veins of ore played out, and the town died. The mines were used as garbage dumps and then sealed shut.<br/><br/>Tombstone eventually resurrected itself as a tourist attraction. But if you ask the average Tombstone tourist WHY all those Wild West types had been living in this otherwise godforsaken part of the world, drinking and gambling and fornicating and killing each other -- you'd probably get a blank stare.<br/><br/>Andree and Shirley De Journett want to change that. Andree is Tombstone's ex-mayor; Shirley is a geologist and Andree's wife. For years they envisioned opening the Good Enough mine as an attraction and a missing link in Tombstone's history. They got their chance when the company that owned the property was told, \"It's not worth anything, it's dangerous, get rid of it,'\" said Shirley. As a measure of its perceived value, the mine was bought by Andree for only $2,000, but he had to pay $60,000 an acre for the surface property above it. He and Shirley then spent six years cleaning out the trash, sand, and rock and making the Good Enough reasonably tourist-safe. They finally reopened it on March 15, 2007.<br/><br/>Visiting the Good Enough makes one thing immediately clear: the silver miners in Tombstone had an easy daily commute. The mining district begins literally a block south of town, and it only takes 30 seconds to walk from the souvenir shops on Toughnut Street to the Good Enough entrance. It's probably the most convenient mine/cave tour in America. It's also dry, dark, and cool, attributes that should not be discounted in the SPF 50 climate of Tombstone.<br/><br/>Unlike the precise symmetry of, say, a coal mine or a salt mine, the Good Enough is a man-made cave. Passages twist and turn, sometimes enlarging into big rooms with soaring ceilings, with the empty spaces where the veins and bodied of silver ore were dug or blasted out by the miners. The mine goes a thousand feet out this way, hundreds of feet down that way. Shafts disappear into the abyss just off of the tour route -- future attractions, no doubt, in the De Journett's subterranean empire, as the Good Enough abuts the Toughnut, Lucky Cuss, West Side, and other mines, running even under the town itself.<br/><br/>Tourists don plastic miner helmets and bright green safety vests (Why? Perhaps it's easier to spot a wayward tour member wandering off the tour route, or at the bottom of an undeveloped shaft...). Groups are shepherded down a steep flight of wooden steps into the main mine tunnel.<br/><br/>Andree knows every vein of ore, every mineral outcropping, every original wooden post, every detail of construction. He spits out facts at every turn and nubbin; the man's energy is impressive. He shows us where he paved and flattened the floor of the mine with concrete and red clay (It used to be all rocky).<br/><br/>He recounts how he paid two guys to live in the mine for six months just to wash the walls so that tourists could \"see the color\" of the various ore veins; \"If this was a working mine,\" he tells us, \"you'd see nothing.\" He explains how he had to dig this room out by hand, blast that passage out with compressed air.<br/><br/>Andree even notes wherever he bumps his head, and paints those rocks blood red, a helpful visual cue that eco-sensitive natural caves can't copy. We don't known if his choice of color was meant for visibility or camouflage, but it certainly made us duck.<br/><br/>Andree and Shirley have big plans for their attraction. A shelter is being built over the mine entrance; burros will be imported to work mine equipment and charm the young; a blacksmith shop will be built along with gift shops and a restaurant and bar. Old miners shacks will be brought in and retrofitted as tourist cabins, so that visitors can spend the night in a miner shack.<br/><br/>\"It's a job, isn't it?\" Andree asks with a catbird grin worthy of Ed Schieffelin. \"But work is cheap. I'll make it work.\" </div> "}, "id": "BXK3SGBV2SPJ2FYH"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/ohio/american-whistle-corporation", "City": "Test", "Name": "American Whistle Corporation", "Longitude": -82.997739, "State/Province": "Ohio", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 40.097489, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Metal Manufacturing", "Description": " American Whistle Corporation is the only manufacturer of metal whistles in the United States... and it makes the loudest whistle in the world - 4 decibels louder than the nearest competitor.<br/><br/>That's why the \"American Classic\" has been chosen as the official whistle of the Boy Scouts of America and the National Fraternal Order of Police.<br/>Come take our guided tour and see \"American Classics\" being made.

Moser Cabinetmakers was founded over a quarter century ago to restore the lost art of fine woodworking. Formerly a Bates college professor, Tom Moser left teaching in 1973 to start making one-of-a-kind furniture in an old Grange Hall in New Gloucester, Maine. His wife Mary managed the selling and finances, while their four sons trained as young apprentices. <br/><br/>There was no business plan, no product, no sense of marketing and to their banker?s horror, no cash or cash flow. <br/><br/>The first advertisement which ran in Down East magazine read, \"Antiques are prized for their qualities of age, design and purity of craftsmanship. Our furniture is inspired by traditional design, constructed with pride and executed by hand, restoring a relationship between man and his practical art.\" Since then little has changed in the company?s intent or product. <br/><br/>Tom?s early designs bore a strong resemblance to Shaker, Queen Anne, Pennsylvania Dutch and other antique forms. From spiral stairs to a waterwheel, from wooden canteens to a harpsichord, the company?s position was, \"if it?s made of wood, we can do it.\" In time this search for a proprietary form was synthesized into a coherent and unified body of work for the home, office and academic environment. <br/><br/>In nearly thirty years, the company has grown from a one-man operation to over sixty cabinetmakers (about half men and half women). Tom Moser continues to conceive and design new products in collaboration with his youngest son, David. His oldest son, Andy Moser is an accomplished craftsman and works in the shop. Aaron Moser directs the company's growing sales to universities and businesses.<br/><br/>In 1987 the company built a new workshop facility in Auburn, Maine, not far from its original location. In addition to mailing catalogs, Thos.

The tour details are below.<br/><br/>The unveiling of the Spaceport America brand shines light on a visionary project many years in the making. New Mexico?s weather and wide-open spaces have been ideal for the aerospace industry since Robert Goddard, the Father of Modern Rocketry, began conducting research in Roswell in the 1930s. He was followed by Wernher von Braun in the 1940s, and NASA in the 1980s. <br/><br/>By the early 1990s, a group of like-minded individuals called, the Southwest Space Task Force, felt the impetus to take New Mexico?s space industry to the next level: commercial space and reusable launch vehicles. Based on years of study, they zeroed in on 27 square-miles of state-owned land, 45 miles north of Las Cruces as a location for an inland spaceport. When Economic Development Cabinet Secretary Rick Homans took office in 2003, they went to him and pleaded their case.<br/><br/>Homans then picked up the torch, presenting the idea of a New Mexico spaceport to Governor Richardson, negotiating with the X Prize Foundation to locate the X Prize Cup in New Mexico, spearheading legislation to finance the spaceport, and most recently, recruiting four aerospace mavericks ? including Virgin Galactic ? to New Mexico.<br/><br/>The New Mexico Spaceport Authority (NMSA) announced that they will begin offering paid public hardhat tours of the Spaceport America construction site beginning December 2009. <br/><br/>The tours will highlight New Mexico history spanning from Spanish conquistadors and pioneer rocket research to the new commercial space industry. Tour participants will receive an on-site tour of the construction site including the runway and vertical launch facility. Tour details and reservation forms will be available on the Spaceport America website (www.spaceportamerica.com) by mid- November.<br/><br/>Guests will tour the construction site and the 10,000-foot runway that is currently under construction, as well as current launch facilities.<br/><br/>Spaceport America is the world's first purpose-built commercial space facility. Spaceport America has been working closely with leading aerospace firms such as Virgin Galactic, Lockheed Martin, Moog-FTS, UP Aerospace, and Armadillo Aerospace to develop commercial spaceflight. Spaceport America's 10,000-foot long runway is now under construction and is expected to be complete by late summer 2010 with the Terminal Hangar Facility projected to be complete by early 2011. </div> "}, "id": "CIUNUVHUCH0P8E6W"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/texas/johnson-space-center", "City": "Test", "Name": "Johnson Space Center", "Longitude": -95.09761, "State/Province": "Texas", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 29.548949, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Welcome to Space Center Houston, the Official Visitor center of NASA's Johnson Space Center.

Here he met Charlie McElevey and Bill Newman, both key figures in the renaissance of craft brewing in the United States. Only nine ?microbreweries? were actively brewing at that time, Charlie and Bill?s among them.<br/><br/>Shortly after that, Mark met Fred Thomasser, a retired brewmaster whose career began with the repeal of prohibition. Fred and Charley agreed to mentor Mark.<br/><br/>Later that year, Mark became involved with St. Paul Mayor George Latimer?s ?Home Grown Economy Project? where he received invaluable assistance and counseling. His dream for a new brewery was beginning to look more like a reality.<br/><br/>To make sure the marketplace was ready for the kind of beer Mark wanted to brew, he began calling on local bars and restaurants to talk with managers and bartenders. This was where potential customers would first experience his new beer. And it?s where they would decide whether or not they would add his beer to their ?list.?<br/><br/>Mark discovered that most establishments were willing to stock and serve a locally-produced craft beer. Most people he spoke with believed that their customers would gladly give the beer a try. Armed with this knowledge, he drafted a business plan to prove to the city and prospective investors that the new brewery could succeed.<br/><br/>The city of St. Paul came through with a low interest loan that allowed the new company to secure the lease on a building. But it would take a year and a half of meetings, phone calls, presentations, not to mention investing everything he had, before Mark raised enough capital to afford the right equipment and a trained staff.<br/><br/>The first three months of 1986 were spent gutting and rehabing a former auto parts warehouse on University Avenue in St. Paul to turn it into a brewery. In late spring of that year, the original brewhouse arrived from Heimertingen, Germany.<br/><br/>After a full summer of test brewing, Summit delivered its first keg on September 25, 1986 to Johnny?s Bar, directly across the street from the brewery. The next day, kegs were delivered to five new accounts.<br/><br/>Later that year, Kincaid?s restaurant opened its doors with Summit Extra Pale Ale on draft. Michael Jackson, noted international beer expert, attended the opening and praised the new local beer for its superb flavor and authenticity.<br/><br/>Jeff Spaeth, head of Sales and Marketing, carried samples of Summit beer in sterilized champagne bottles for new accounts to try. If he made the sale, he returned in the one and only Summit van to deliver the beer and set up the draft line.<br/><br/>By June of 1987, Summit had over 40 draft accounts. But the brewery was still too small to interest a distributor. So Mark, Jeff and others were literally selling Summit Extra Pale Ale and Summit Great Northern Porter door-to-door. <br/><br/>They were so successful that by the end of 1987, Summit had a bottling line up and running, a Gold Medal for Great Northern Porter from the Great American Beer Festival, a new Winter Ale seasonal, and established wholesalers more than willing to distribute Summit beer.<br/><br/>In 1993, Summit tripled its square footage by leasing the building behind the original brewery. A 250-foot pipeline was installed to pump the beer from the fermentation tanks through the filters to the ?bright? beer tanks where the beer was held to fill bottles and kegs.<br/><br/>Throughout 1994 ? 1995 Summit introduced the rest of what is today the Summit line-up of beers (although there will be more).<br/><br/>In 1997, Summit increased its output to 31,400 barrels. It was becoming clear that with more and more beer lovers wanting more and more Summit beer, a new facility would have to be built. That year, ground was broken for the first brewery to be built in the Twin Cities in over one hundred years.<br/><br/>As Summit grows into the new facility, important new faces have joined the team. Experienced brewing chemist Gerri Kustelski signed on as Director of Quality Control in 1998. And Horace Cunningham, Brewmaster extraordinaire at Banks Brewing in Barbados, became Summit?s new Brewmaster and Production Manager in 2001.<br/><br/>Today, Summit Extra Pale Ale is extremely popular in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.

At Nora Mill, we grind corn daily using either the original French burr stones that are water powered by the Chattahoochee River - or by our more modern \"Meal Master\" stone grinding system located on our second floor. Either way, all product is all natural and is stone ground.<br/><br/>Nora Mill Granary, Inc. Est. 1876<br/><br/>About the mill . . . .<br/><br/>Nora Mill Granary is an operational gristmill sitting alongside the Chattahoochee River in the foothills of the North Georgia Mountains that stone grinds and produces all kinds of corn and wheat based products such as grits, corn meal, pancake &amp; waffle mixes, flours, biscuit &amp; bread mixes, pioneer's porridge, and the like. In addition, we have an old-fashioned country store &amp; gift shop that we have named \"Nora Mill Next Door,\" that is stocked with thousands of new items and even has a large kitchen built just for cooking &amp; serving samples of our mill &amp; store products.<br/><br/>A little history . . . .<br/><br/>The mill itself is a large four-story building that was built in 1876 complete with 1,500 pound French Burr Mill Stones and a 100 ft. wooden raceway that feeds water to a water turbine - not a vertical water wheel. The mill was constructed in 1876 by John Martin when he came to Georgia to mine for gold. Unlike most miners, Mr. Martin made Sautee-Nacoochee Valley his permanent home in 1902 Dr. Lamartine G. Hardman, governor of Georgia from 1927 -1931, bought the mill and named it \"Nora Mill\" in memory of his sister Nora. Nora Mill remained in the Hardman Family until 1998, when it, along with 300 surrounding acres, was purchased by a group of investors associated with Nacoochee Village, Ltd.<br/><br/>After a succession of millers throughout the years, in the early 1980s, Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Ron Fain worked with the Hardman family and leased Nora Mill for him and his parents to bring back to life and operate. Ron became the Miller of Nora Mill. Over the years, Ron worked with his parents until their passing, and then brought his youngest daughter Joann in under his wing to learn the art of milling and work the Nora Mill business with him.<br/><br/>Ron and Joann together, developed and brought to market a number of corn &amp; grain recipes that are famous to Nora Mill. Recipes such as \"Georgia Ice Cream\", \"Dixie Ice Cream\", \"Pioneer's Porridge\", and the like. They expanded the product offerings and opened the gift shop next door to the mill and named it \"Nora Mill Next Door\". Joann and Ron worked shoulder to shoulder until his recent passing in June of 2001.<br/><br/>Nora Mill is now in the third generation of the Fain family operation as Joann Fain Tarpley, with husband Rich, continues to manage and operate Nora Mill Granary. The fourth generation of the same family can be seen at Nora Mill Granary as the children of Joann and Rich are actively working with them at the mill.<br/><br/>Ron Fain and daughter Joann<br/><br/>There have been many changes over the years, but the main idea is still the same, to grind fresh grains with no additives or preservatives with old-fashioned quality. Nora Mill has recently gone through a major refurbishing. The dam, raceway, and penstock have been rebuilt. We have enclosed the breezeway and have built new porch &amp; deck that overlooks our very own gigantic rainbow trout swimming in the beautiful Chattahoochee River. We have recently refurbished our grinding and milling machinery to ensure the highest of quality in the products that we produce, hand-bag, and offer on-site in our mill and through our Internet &amp; mail order business.<br/><br/>More about today's operation . . . .<br/><br/>Managing and operating Nora Mill Granary today is Joann Fain Tarpley and husband Rich. Together, the two oversee all aspects of the mill from overall general business management to the grinding and milling operations.<br/><br/>Rich &amp; Joann Tarpley<br/><br/>Prior to Ron's passing, Rich was fortunate to have the opportunity to spend time with Ron to learn the rare art of milling and to learn the \"inner workings\" of the mill itself. Ron taught Rich how to \"listen and feel\" the heartbeat of the mill and how to adjust the millstones and flow of grain to achieve the perfect Nora Mill blend.<br/><br/>Over the years, every one has worked to develop a nice mail order business that began with the mailing of very simple brochures to the folks that sign our guest book as they visit the mill. Today, the mail order catalog is mailed out to over 30,000 \"guests\" that have either signed the book at the mill, or have requested a catalog via telephone or the web. To request a catalog, send Joann an e-mail with your mailing address or sign our mailing list form on this site.<br/><br/>Everyone working in around Nora Mill is considered family. We consider our work a labor of love and take great pride in everything we do. Whether taking an order on the phone for a single bag of grits or working with one of our wholesale accounts for a 2,000 lb order of stone ground products, we treat everyone the same! We love what we do and we love working with people.<br/><br/>Please stop in for a visit whenever you can. We would love to show you around. Nora Mill is open every day except Christmas &amp; Easter.<br/><br/>Fain family history . . . .<br/><br/>The Fain Family roots began in Northeast Georgia area just a few miles from Nora Mill where Ron's father, George, resided until 1917 before moving to Ohio in search of work. While in Ohio, George met and married Florence McPherson and together raised 4 children. Ron, the youngest boy, was raised in Ohio where he met and married Rita Lepera. After graduating from the University of Akron and retiring from the US Army as a Lt. Colonel in 1979, Ron and Rita, with their 5 children settled in Helen, Ga. at his family homestead.<br/><br/>George &amp; Florence Fain<br/><br/>Ron &amp; Rita Fain<br/><br/>As Ron got involved with Nora Mill, he became so interested in preserving a bit of history that he buried himself in books and publications and sought help from knowledgeable individuals including long time miller of Nora Mill, Tom Farmer, and Clyde Keltner of Tennessee. As Ron received his on-the-job education of the lost art of grain milling by water-power, he became and stayed active in the Society of the Preservation of Old Mills.<br/><br/>In the early years, Ron &amp; Rita and all of the children worked hard to keep Nora Mill running. Son David worked on the mill building, rebuilt the raceway and dam several times over. Oldest daughter Janet worked with Ron in the mill, came up with the idea of cooking and serving samples at the mill, and has published 2 Nora Mill Cookbooks which can be purchased on-line and/or at our mill. Daughters Joyce, Judy, and Joann all worked at the mill while in school. Like her father, Joann developed a deep love for the mill and has continued to work at the mill throughout the years and to present day.<br/><br/>Ron's spirit is alive and well within the walls of Nora Mill today. Ron's wife Rita helps whenever possible and when called upon. Ron has touched all of our lives. We are very proud to have been close to him. We all are anxious to share our most remembered \"Ron Stories\" amongst ourselves and with guests visiting as a number of the guests that return to the mill - visit not only to restock on the great products that we have - but also to sit and talk about Ron, who has left a great impression on their lives as well. </div> "}, "id": "D2YLD8UZRG25X1PO"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/virginia/rowenas", "City": "Test", "Name": "Rowena's", "Longitude": -76.294523, "State/Province": "Virginia", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 36.87128, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " You will discover Wonderful Pound Cakes, special sauces and jams that make perfect gifts or that can be used for your own pleasure.

Myrtlewood logs, when green are 70% moisture so the log will not float. The wood is 20% harder than oak, and harder than black walnut or hardrock maple. No other wood is so strongly accented by figured grain and color.<br/><br/>Myrtlewood has a color spectrum that has been variously described as ranging from \"golden hues to velvet black with warm brown, yellows, greens and reds\", from \"ebony to a rich maple color\", from \"soft gray to mauve\". In a single word, it is beautiful!<br/><br/>A skilled sawyer is needed to operate the carriage to saw each log in recognition of the individuality of each finished piece. The head rig saws 1 \u00bc, 2 \u00bc, 3 \u00bc, and 4 \u00bc inch boards. From there the board goes to the planer where one side is planed. This makes it easier to see the defects in the planks. The straight-line ripsaw is now used to cut the boards to standard widths. The mill is always cutting for the largest piece they can possibly get.<br/><br/>Next, the chop-saw cuts for the standard square blocks, which are always done 1-inch oversize to allow for shrinkage during the drying process. A center hole is drilled which will be used throughout the process. The square blocks are now cut into rounds.<br/><br/>The next step is the rough-out lathe. Each item is roughed to the shape of the finished piece leaving 1-inch thick walls. This speeds up the drying process and helps to prevent checking and warpage. Even with this preventative measure, we will still lose about 10% in the dry kilns.<br/><br/>These roughed out items are now loaded into our four large dry kilns. Temperature and humidity are then carefully controlled for 5-9 weeks. Table tops and lumber must be air-dried one year per inch of thickness. Then they are placed in the kiln for final drying. All items are brought slowly down to at least 7% moisture content. <br/><br/>After the wood is dry it is bottom-sanded so it will fit flush with the faceplate on the lathe. The turners make their owns steel chisels. They do the outside of an item first, then the inside. The turner changes tools often; different tools are for different curves, etc. Most turners use their fingers for calipers. They feel just the right thickness.<br/><br/>After being turned, the item goes to the sander where we use 80-220 grit sandpaper. This process is used on the outside and then the inside of the item. On items that are to be sprayed, three to four coats of spray are applied to each item and then allowed to dry overnight. The items may be washed with soap and water, but will not withstand the high temperature of a dishwasher<br/><br/>To obtain an oil finish, the item is hand-rubbed with oil. It is allowed to dry overnight and then waxed to a satin sheen. We suggest that the oil finish be occasionally re-rubbed with mineral oil to prevent the absorption of food odors, and to keep the wood from drying out. Each buyer will receive a \"story of myrtlewood\" which tells how to care for his/her item. </div> "}, "id": "DAD808XCD6D840NA"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/knigge-farms-llc", "City": "Test", "Name": "Knigge Farms LLC", "Longitude": -88.807242, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 44.05616, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Half hour guided tour of a working family dairy farm using robotic milking technology.

Every year we host thousands of visitors who come to view the animals, learn about the project and take advantage of this unique opportunity to see and photograph one of the Arctic's oldest living species. For a truly Alaskan experience, come visit the farm and take an informative tour led by a knowledgeable guide. See tame cows, powerful bulls, and newborn calves that will make your heart melt.<br/><br/>The goal of the Musk Ox Project, begun in 1954, is to introduce a gentle, non-intrusive form of agriculture to the Arctic. These animals form the basis of an Alaskan cottage industry for natives living in remote coastal villages. The soft under-wool of the musk ox, qiviut, is harvested once a year and delivered to Oomingmak, an Alaskan native knitter's co-operative. The knitters work at home in Eskimo villages throughout Alaska creating scarves, nachaqs (Eskimo smoke rings) and luxurious caps. Each village has it's own signature pattern derived from traditional designs. For more information about qiviut and the native knitter's cooperative, link to www.qiviut.com. <br/><br/>The Musk Ox Farm, located just outside of Palmer, Alaska (a scenic 50-minute drive from downtown Anchorage) is home to a unique domestication project which began in 1954. The Musk Ox Farm is an ideal place to observe and photograph these animals at close range. On the tour you'll learn about the history of the musk ox, a prehistoric remnant of the last great Ice Age, and how it has been domesticated on the farm. You'll see cows, powerful bulls, and tame yearlings. The Musk Ox Project promotes the use of qiviut (the fine under-wool of the musk ox) as the basis of an Arctic native textile industry, which provides an economic supplement to subsistence communities throughout Alaska. </div> "}, "id": "DROJXBARJ98CTMQ3"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/hawaii/tedeschi-vineyards", "City": "Test", "Name": "Tedeschi Vineyards", "Longitude": -156.328869, "State/Province": "Hawaii", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 20.756765, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Located in one of the most historic buildings on the island of Maui.

William L. Libbey moved the firm to New Bedford in 1870. A reorganization of the company in 1874 brought Frederick S. Shirley to the firm as the new manager; and, under him, many new types of glass were developed and patented including: Burmese, Peachblow, Lava, Rose Amber, Royal Flemish, and Satin glass. Mount Washington became noted for its brilliant cut glass and was awarded a certificate of merit for its exhibit at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876.<br/><br/>In 1880, a brittania works called the Pairpoint Manufacturing Company was erected on land adjacent to the Mount Washington Glass Company. The works were named after its first superintendent, Thomas J. Pairpoint. At the time, Mr. Pairpoint was considered one of the greatest silver designers in England and America. This new company became one of the largest manufacturers of silverplated ware in the USA.<br/><br/>The two companies merged in 1894 and became known as the Pairpoint Corporation. Pairpoint soon became a leader in the glass industry.<br/><br/>Since 1970, the Pairpoint glass factory has been active in Sagamore on Cape Cod. Although the physical plant is not that large, the scope of the glass made here since has been tremendous. Hand-blown vases, stemware, decanters, perfume bottles, pitchers, cream and sugar sets, lamps, candlesticks, bottles, and paperweights are among the many items made at the factory alongside the Cape Cod Canal. Colors made here include sapphire blue, cobalt blue, gold ruby, Pairpoint ruby, rosaria, vaseline, opal, amethyst, camellia, auroria, amber and Pairpoint cranberry. The company supplies such customers as Tiffany's, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, The Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and Artisans in Glass. And, many unusual items in varying shapes or forms, some one-of-a-kind, are quickly purchased by the visitors to the factory.<br/><br/>In 1974, Pairpoint began pressing cup plates with new and original designs. There are more than 100 different cup plates on the market today, and some of them have become very collectible since they were made in limited editions. </div> "}, "id": "ECSR1LN3BWQWYB2V"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/utah/taffy-town", "City": "Test", "Name": "Taffy Town", "Longitude": -111.892766, "State/Province": "Utah", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 40.751772, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " For over 79 years we were known as Glade Candy Company offering individuals the finest in Gourmet Taffy.

The first wine, a 1988 Chardonnay was released for sale in November of 1989. Current production is 6,000 cases annually.<br/><br/>Chamard Vineyards is dedicated to producing fine wines from classic European wine grapes. A blend of time-honored wine making techniques and state of the art winery equipment are used to create world class wines. The main focus at Chamard is on Chardonnay, the most noble white wine grape variety in the world and the best variety that grows in the region. The vineyards spread across 40 acres of gently sloping fields along the southern Connecticut coast, just two miles from Long Island Sound. The 20 acres of established vines include the varieties Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Chamard's classic New England styled winery features finely crafted stonework using field stones from the property and wooden beams milled from trees harvested from the property.<br/><br/>Chamard benefits from a unique micro-climate influenced greatly by Long Island Sound. Located two miles from the sound and six miles from the mouth of the Connecticut River, this maritime climate produces mild winter temperatures and a long, warm growing season. The rich, stony soil, gently sloping land and moderate climate provide an ideal environment for the growing of European wine grapes. <br/><br/>The Chamard Vineyard tour takes you through the winery for an informative look at our wine making process. After the tour, you'll be treated to a complimentary tasting of Chamard wines in the tasting room overlooking the vineyards. The winery was completed in 1988.

Located in East Moline, Illinois, it is approximately 90 acres under roof (that's nearly 4 million square feet) and has produced products since 1913. <br/><br/>How We Build Your Combine<br/>=========================<br/>A majority of your combine components start as a roll of steel. Each roll weighs 10-to 20-tons, is 4-to 6-feet wide, and comes in thickness up to 1/4-inch. Steel is fed into a machine which cuts it to various lengths, then flattens it. The flat steel is sent to different stations to be made into smaller parts. <br/><br/>Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines, capable of holding 37 unique punches in a large wheel, are used to create various combinations of parts. Harvester Works also uses lasers that cut at rates of up to 400-inches per minute. Presses are used for larger sheet metal forming and can apply 400-to 1000-tons of pressure. <br/><br/>120,000 Square Feet of Paint Technology<br/>=======================================<br/>Parts at John Deere Harvester are immersed 10 times during the pre-paint process. Each of the 10 stages contains approximately 50,000 gallons of continuously circulated liquid that may reach temperatures of 150 degrees F. <br/><br/>After the pre-treatment process, a coat of paint (0.8-1.0-mil) is applied and baked for 68 minutes at 275 degrees F. The three-stage electrocoat process is capable of operating at 600 volts and 2000 degrees. At this stage of the paint process, four Fanuc P200 robots capable of painting 39-inches per second apply a final topcoat. Under normal conditions, a part is involved in the paint process for approximately 5 hours from start to finish. <br/><br/>Assembly of Your Combine<br/>========================<br/>14 miles of automated track comes together to form the main Harvester Works building. Here, the sub-assemblies of your combine include: <br/><br/>Body (separator cleaning shoe) <br/>Engine <br/>Feeder house <br/>Grain tank <br/><br/>Purchased parts such as engines, radiators, and fuel tanks arrive Just In Time (JIT) at loading docks near their final point of use. Parts arrive from all over the United States and from sister factories all over the world. These major sub-assemblies come together on the \"main line\" to be assembled into your finished combine. <br/><br/>Delivery Process<br/>================<br/>After the combine is completely assembled, it is pre-delivered by an independent company that inspects the combine from front to back for proper fluids, torques, and tensions in key areas. This same company helps provide customer support during the summer harvest. </div> "}, "id": "GUA30IYHB09RSSNF"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/montana/smokejumper-center", "City": "Test", "Name": "Smokejumper Center", "Longitude": -114.09119, "State/Province": "Montana", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 46.926241, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Misc", "Description": " Missoula, Montana is the location of the Northern Region headquarters of the USDA Forest Service Smokejumpers which encompasses twelve National Forests throughout the entire state of Montana and the northern half of Idaho .

The oil-fired station is operated on an \"as needed\" basis during periods of extreme hot or cold temperatures (when the demand for electricity exceeds the capacity of base-load facilities), increased agricultural loads (including irrigation) and emergencies. <br/><br/>Construction on the $30 million peaking station began in December 1976, and commercial operation began in the spring of 1978. The 120,000-kilowatt plant consists of two 60,000- kilowatt combustion units that are operated from the plant or remotely from the Leland Olds Station near Stanton, ND. <br/><br/>Spirit Mound Station was built adjacent to a fuel pipeline, near existing transmission facilities and close to existing load centers to minimize plant costs and environmental impacts. The station meets or exceeds all state and Federal air and noise pollution control standards. <br/><br/>Even though the Spirit Mound Station does not operate often, it plays an important role in maintaining system reliability. Meeting the electricity needs for rural electric consumers in the region has many complex components -- equipment failure, uncertainty of predicting power needs, weather and fuel supply. The best insurance for dealing with all of these problems is reserves -- spare generating capacity that can be called on immediately when needed. </div> "}, "id": "HCYB6GPSF43FR0UB"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/north-carolina/all-american-homes-of-north-carolina", "City": "Test", "Name": "All American Homes of North Carolina", "Longitude": -81.929159, "State/Province": "North\u00a0Carolina", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.31624, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Welcome Home<br/>============<br/>Much more than sticks and bricks, your home is a sanctuary from the pressures of work, errands, and untold commitments.

Matt I, a German-born immigrant, left a promising career at the famous Duke of Baden Brewery in the Black Forest region of Germany to travel to the United States with the determination and dream of owning his own brewery someday. After several years of brewing experience at the Bierbaur Brewery, F.X. Matt re-organized the faltering brewery to create The West End Brewing Company in 1888.

At the time, it was as speculative a new business venture as the dot com start-ups of the 1990's -- a company founded with no brands, no available stocks of whiskey, and at the height of the Great Depression. Today, the company has overcome these initial challenges and grown to become the largest independent, family-owned producer and marketer of distilled spirits in the country. According to industry analysts, Heaven Hill is now the seventh largest spirits supplier in the United States and is the second largest holder of aging Bourbon whiskey in the world with an inventory in excess of 675,000 barrels. <br/>Over the last two decades Heaven Hill has moved beyond its traditional focus on American whiskeys to become a broadly diversified spirits supplier. Heaven Hill's portfolio includes both domestically produced products, such as Evan Williams Bourbon and Christian Brothers Brandy, as well as a growing line of selected imported brands from around the world, such as Hpnotiq Liqueur and Isle of Jura Single Malt Scotch. Brands are identified and developed to take advantage of the many varied consumer tastes that exist in the vast U.S. distilled spirits market. These brands are then sold on a national basis through an innovative and aggressive marketing and sales organization under a concept that is unique to the industry. <br/>With an already robust business in the United States, Heaven Hill has now mounted an aggressive international expansion plan, forming partnerships with like-minded companies throughout the world. Heaven Hill has established its brands in over 40 countries throughout Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, Central and South America. <br/>The company's success is based on the fact that it is large enough to market brands aggressively in the United States and throughout the world, yet small enough to care about every brand and be responsive to the needs of every customer. Heaven Hill's formula for growth begins with the commitment to support its current portfolio of brands, while continuing to diversify by adding new products through internal development, agency relationships and acquisitions. Throughout its product line, Heaven Hill offers a competitive advantage by emphasizing unique characteristics like extra aging, superior quality, innovative packaging and uncompromised craftsmanship. Whether it is a Bourbon from Kentucky's First Distiller, such as Evan Williams, or a Gin first produced by the Lord Mayor of London, such as Burnett's, Heaven Hill products enjoy heritage, history and an unexcelled reputation.<br/>In stark contrast to the unpredictable and ever-consolidating spirits industry, Heaven Hill remains fiercely independent, guided by the steady hands of the Shapira family. The company is dedicated to establishing long-term relationships with their customers in order to build strong brands and implement consistent, effective programming. Heritage, stability and dedication define Heaven Hill Distilleries, Inc., a company committed to producing and marketing the highest quality spirits products worldwide.<br/>Company Timeline<br/><br/>1783 -- William Heavenhill is born \"during an Indian raid which was being waged, under the cliffs near Rowan Creek\" at the site of present day Heaven Hill Distilleries.<br/><br/>1783 -- Evan Williams sets up his distillery on the banks of the Ohio in Louisville at what is now 4th Street, thereby becoming Kentucky's First Distiller.<br/><br/>1789 -- Rev. Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and farmer who had immigrated to Kentucky from Virginia, experiences a fire in his barn where he stores whiskey barrels. Putting his new whiskey in the burnt barrels anyway, Craig soon discovered that the whiskey would age better in the charred barrels, picking up color and flavor, and earning Craig the title of the \"Father of Bourbon.\"<br/><br/>1837 -- Henry McKenna arrives in Kentucky from his native County Derry, Ireland. He sets up his distillery in Fairfield in 1855 where he begins producing his eponymous Bourbon, known as \"Kentucky's Finest Table Whiskey.\"<br/><br/>1870 -- John E. Fitzgerald introduces his \"private label\" Bourbon, Old Fitzgerald, available only on rail and steamship lines and private clubs.<br/><br/>1934 -- Heaven Hill Distilleries, Inc., originally known as \"Old Heavenhill Springs\" distillery, is founded by a group of Bardstown-area investors and the five Shapira brothers, David, Ed, Gary, George and Mose.

So vast was the complex that it became an entity almost to itself: all the raw ingredients necessary for the smelting process were found on the plantation, and artisan shops, stores, schools, churches and village housing sprung up within the complex and around the perimeter.<br/><br/>Cornwall Furnace is indeed a unique survivor of the early American iron industry. Originally built by Peter Grubb in 1742, the furnace underwent extensive renovations in 1856-57 under its subsequent owners, the Coleman family, and closed in 1883. It is this mid-19th century iron making complex which survives today. At Cornwall, furnace, blast equipment, and related buildings still stand as they did over a century ago. Here visitors can explore the rambling Gothic Revival buildings where cannons, stoves, and pig iron were cast, and where men labored day and night to satisfy the furnace?s appetite for charcoal, limestone, and iron ore.<br/><br/>Cornwall Iron Furnace is an extraordinary example of the furnaces that dotted the Pennsylvania countryside in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it is now the only surviving intact site of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and stands as a testament to the great iron industry that once flourished in this region.<br/><br/>Guided tours through this National Historic Landmark will explain the history of this unique site and discuss the iron manufacturing process.

Combining his business background with his passion for beer, which was developed through his international travels and his experience as a homebrewer, he decided to start a brewery. He set up shop in an abandoned dairy-processing plant at the edge of downtown Denver and began brewing the beers that would eventually carry Great Divide Brewing Company to its status as one of America's most decorated microbreweries and would help transform Denver into an international destination for beer lovers.<br/><br/>Brian Dunn's goal was to create adventurous beers that reflect the Colorado lifestyle. He wanted to capture Denver's urban energy and Colorado's awe-inspiring mountains. From great session beers like DPA to massively hoppy, big beers like Hercules, Great Divide has become synonymous with progressive, balanced, assertive hand-crafted ales. <br/><br/>The excellence of our beer is the result of our unwavering commitment to both experimentation and quality. A beer like Old Ruffian would never be imagined without the former, nor would it be drinkable without the latter.

Spangler purchases the Gold Leaf Baking Company of Defiance, Ohio for $450 and moves it to 204 W. High Street in Bryan, Ohio. The new company is named Spangler Manufacturing Company, and produces baking soda, baking powder, corn starch, laundry starch, spices, and flavorings. <br/><br/>1908 Arthur's brother Ernest Spangler joins the company and suggests adding candy to the line. Candy would sell quickly. <br/><br/>1910 By 1910, the business outgrows its first location. Larger quarters are found at 205 S. Main Street in Bryan, Ohio. <br/><br/>1913 The business moves to its present location on N.

Spangler now manufactures the following: Creme Peanut Clusters, Cocoanut Balls, Bryan Drops, hand dipped chocolates, chocolate bars, ice cream cones, soda pop and cough drops. <br/><br/>1920 All products manufactured at the company are candy, so the name is changed from Spangler Manufacturing Company to Spangler Candy Company.<br/> <br/>1922 Hard candy equipment is purchased and stick candy is manufactured. One of the most successful hard candies is a penny apple sucker. The sticks are placed in by hand and the pop is sold unwrapped. Chocolate equipment is also purchased, which eliminates the need to hand dip the chocolate items. A variety of 60 products are being made and shipped. <br/><br/>1927 A candy jobbing business and retail store is opened in Maumee,Ohio. <br/><br/>1945 Arthur Spangler, along with three other prominent citizens of Bryan, Ohio, drowns in Snow Lake, Indiana, while fishing. <br/><br/>1946 The company is reorganized from a partnership to a corporation. <br/><br/>1947 By 1947, the second generation of Spanglers joins the company. <br/> <br/>1953 Dum Dum Pops from Akron Candy Co. of Bellevue, Ohio is purchased. <br/> <br/>1954 A-Z Christmas Candy Canes of Detroit, Michigan is purchased. <br/><br/>1960 The first union contract with Toledo Local 20 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is signed. <br/><br/>1960 The second generation Spanglers now actively manage the company.

But the founding of Mrs Baird's Bread wasn't exactly a smooth road.<br/><br/>In 1901 William and Ninnie Baird brought their family from Tennessee to Fort Worth, Texas. William, a restaurateur by trade, set up a business in downtown Fort Worth selling popcorn from a bright red cart with brass fittings and a loud steam whistle. Within months his success led him to buy another popcorn cart which was run by his oldest son, Dewey, only eight-years-old. But it wasn't long before William Baird decided to get back into the restaurant business.<br/><br/>By 1905, William Baird had started, built up and sold one restaurant and was working on his second, when he received devastating news. He was diagnosed as having diabetes, in those days an incurable and untreatable disease.<br/><br/>Although very ill, William Baird and his young son Dewey worked in the family restaurant. Ninnie Baird tended to the home and her three other sons, and like everyone else of that time, she baked for her family.<br/><br/>Every day she would cut wood to fire the wood-burning stove. It was hot, sometimes dirty work, but in spite of the lack of modern conveniences, Mrs. Baird became a wonderful baker. The loaves of bread, cakes and pies she baked, the family enjoyed. Any extra was shared with the neighbors. Her bread was so delicious that it wasn't long before her reputation was known far and wide.<br/><br/>Ninnie did all her baking in a wood-fired stove...<br/><br/>In 1908, with William's health failing, it became impossible for him to continue working. It was clear that Ninnie Baird needed to find a way to help support her family, so she established Mrs Baird's Bread.<br/><br/>In 1911, William died and Ninnie Baird decided to continue the business she had begun. Every day, in her home, in a wood-burning stove that could bake only four loaves at a time, Ninnie baked her wonderful bread, cakes and pies. Her boys helped bake and deliver the bread on foot. Her daughters took care of the smaller children and did other chores around the house. Mrs Baird's Bread was truly a family business.<br/><br/>As business grew, the boys went from delivering bread on foot, to riding bicycles.<br/><br/>In 1915, demand for Mrs Baird's bread had outgrown Ninnie's wood-burning stove. A larger oven was needed so she bought a commercial oven from the Metropolitan Hotel in Fort Worth. Unable to pay cash for the $75 oven, Ninnie put down $25 and paid out the rest in bread and rolls. The new oven, which could bake 40 loaves at a time, was installed in a small wooden building in the family's backyard.<br/><br/>Sales continued to grow to the point where the boys could not make deliveries on their bicycles. So, the Baird's buggy was converted into a wagon and pulled by the family horse, Ned. The first company employee, Mr. Lipps, who was not a Baird family member, was hired to drive the wagon.<br/><br/>Ned, it turns out, was quite a delivery horse. He came to know the route so well that he would stop at every customer's house without the urging of his driver. Over time, delivering to the sales route became son Hoyt's job. In 1917 the family bought a Ford passenger car, took out the seats and painted \"Eat More Mrs Baird's Bread\" on the sides.<br/><br/>Old Ned retires and expansion begins...<br/><br/>About this time Mrs Baird's Bread began selling to commercial accounts. Two Telephone Exchanges bought pies daily and Sandegard's Grocery became the company's first bread reseller. Sandegard's, a large store with a delicatessen, proved to be a very good customer as it soon grew to 15 stores, all displaying Mrs Baird's Bread prominently in a glass case.<br/><br/>In 1918, Hoyt Baird left Fort Worth to join the Army, leaving the company without a delivery driver. It was decided to discontinue selling direct and concentrate instead on selling only wholesale. Demand steadily increased, and so did the bakery. Now located at 6th Avenue and Terrell Street, the little 30 foot by 72 foot facility housed an oven that could bake 400 loaves at a time. Wholesale deliveries now stretched into every corner of Fort Worth, where fresh-baked bread, rolls, cakes and pies were delivered every day. Over the next ten years the bakery was enlarged nine times, until it was one of the largest baking facilities in Texas.<br/><br/>In 1928, the Bairds opened a new bakery across the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The stock market crash of 1929 signaled the start of the Great Depression, and, like everyone else, Mrs Baird's Bread had to cut back to survive those lean times. By 1938, business was returning to normal and the bakery needed to expand again. They built a new bakery in Houston, Texas and added another plant in Fort Worth. Once a one-horse delivery system, now a fleet of trucks was needed at each of the four bakeries. The two new bakeries also featured plate glass windows so that visitors could watch the baking process. Not only could you smell the delicious bread, but you could watch it being made as well.<br/><br/>In the 1940's, America entered World War II and the country saw a shortage of many items, like sugar. Because they went off to fight the war, workers were also in short supply. These shortages forced Mrs Baird's to reduce the number and kinds of bread product it baked, but it never compromised on quality. If an ingredient was in short supply, then the bakery just didn't bake that item for a while.<br/><br/>Post War Growth establishes Mrs Baird's as Texas' Bread<br/><br/>Following the war, in 1949, Mrs Baird's expanded again building a bakery in Abilene, Texas. In 1959 and 1960 the company acquired bakeries in the Texas cities of Victoria, Lubbock, Waco and Austin.<br/><br/>Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, the company prospered. Ninnie Baird, the namesake of the thriving company, however, experienced declining health. Now 80, she stayed at home most of the time. The boys handled most of the day-to-day operations, but Ninnie Baird, still the Chairman of the Board, was always consulted on the major decisions. The family's commitment to quality, freshness and service never waivered. It was a work ethic that was passed on from generation to generation as well as, the importance of family, a Christian upbringing, and community. From the beginning until her death, she shared with her neighbors and her community.<br/><br/>Tour one of Mrs Baird's Bakeries and see firsthand how Mrs Baird's Bread is baked.

Known for its outstanding taste, unmatched freshness and superior quality, the bread was carefully baked each day, and delivered ? still warm from the oven ? in wicker laundry baskets to a growing number of customers residing in and around neighboring Youngstown, Ohio. <br/> <br/>Building A Business On The Finest Bread<br/><br/>In just a few short years, the reputation of Schwebel's bread spread far and wide. The bakery's customer list continued to expand, and delivery operations now depended on horse and wagon ? instead of wicker baskets ? to deliver the oven-fresh bread.<br/><br/>In 1914, Dora and Joseph entered the world of retail sales by working out agreements with several local ?mom and pop? stores ? a move that opened up new and more profitable sales channels for their fledgling business. To ensure that fresh bread was in the stores when customers asked for it, the young couple added more bakers to assist the family, and even hired the company's first driver/salesperson to complement the horse and wagon.<br/><br/>The strong economy of the 1920's kept operations humming along, and more and more people experienced the taste and quality of Schwebel's bread. In 1923, the Schwebel's invested $25,000 and built a small bakery complete with a store front for retail business. At this time, the family could bake and deliver 1,000 loaves a day using six delivery trucks. The bakery was on the move and the future looked bright. Unfortunately, tragedy was just around the corner. In 1928, Joseph Schwebel died suddenly at the age of 46 ? leaving Dora with six children and the family's business to run by herself.<br/><br/>Challenges And Difficult Decisions<br/><br/>In 1928, many people believed the baking business was no place for a woman with young children. Dora Schwebel was told she should sell her bakery and stay home with her children, but she wouldn't hear of it. Instead, she stared down the naysayers and decided to carry on with the business she helped to build with her husband. Against all odds, Dora forged ahead to keep her family thriving. <br/><br/>The stock market crashed in the fall of 1929, less than a year after Joseph Schwebel's passing, and Dora and her young family found out just how difficult running a business could be.<br/><br/>Vowing to meet her obligations by working all day and all night if necessary, Dora skillfully negotiated a number of critical agreements that kept the business running in the face of national financial ruin. She built a new bakery in 1936 that doubled production and improved efficiency, and added to it in 1938 and again in 1941. And through it all, she found the time and financial resources to help the less fortunate. <br/><br/>By the late 1940's, demand for the company's products was growing by leaps and bounds as soldiers returned home from World War II and the baby boom began. <br/><br/>Riding The Wave Of Success In The Fifties And Sixties<br/><br/>In 1951, Dora and her children moved into their ?million-dollar bakery,? a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility on Youngstown's Midlothian Boulevard, outfitted with equipment and baking processes that would transform the Schwebel family's baking business. <br/><br/>The family, proud of the new bakery, and thankful to suppliers and local citizens who enthusiastically supported the big move, planned elaborate Grand Opening festivities. The Schwebel's invited the entire community to tour the modern bakery and celebrate with the family. The new bakery allowed the company to continue expanding product lines and distribution channels. <br/><br/>The 1960's marked the beginning of the third generation's active participation in the company. Their entry would add vitality, new ideas, and a quest for rapid growth and expansion outside of Youngstown. In 1967, the popularity of Schwebel's Golden Rich Bread led to a successful national licensing program throughout the country.<br/><br/>Extending The Reach Of Great Taste<br/><br/>By the end of the 1970's, the company had noticeably expanded its distribution network. In rapid fashion, Schwebel's had now become a key player in the Canton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland, Ohio markets. In addition, the company had undertaken a significant bakery expansion program that fully automated the bread and buns lines, doubling capacity.<br/><br/>Record growth characterized the 1980's and 1990's. As a result of several key acquisitions, Schwebel's had become a regional force in the baking industry. To complement this expansion the company added distribution facilities in Columbus, Ohio and Buffalo, New York. This period also heralded special baking agreements with Stouffer's, Pillsbury, and Walt Disney's Epcot Center.<br/><br/>Growing The Company Into The Future<br/><br/>For more than 100 years after its humble beginnings in a suburban Youngstown kitchen, Schwebel Baking Company continues to produce the breads people ask for by name. With more than 1,400 team members dedicated to maintaining the company's standards of quality, freshness, and honest hard work, the Schwebel family makes sure that customers get nothing short of great taste every time. Joseph and Dora wouldn't have it any other way. </div> "}, "id": "KMWMNQQUEZLEWUPK"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/north-carolina/roush-fenway-racing", "City": "Test", "Name": "Roush Fenway Racing", "Longitude": -80.718267, "State/Province": "North\u00a0Carolina", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.384954, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Jack Roush has always been interested in finding out why and how things work. If there was anything mechanical in the house, he would take it apart to see how it worked and reassemble it. He was fascinated with engines and was determined to become an innovator.<br/><br/>Born in Covington, Ky., in 1942, Roush was raised in Manchester, Ohio, a town of 2,500 people. He attended Berea College and received a mathematics degree with a minor in physics in 1964. He was recruited by Ford Motor Company that year and moved to Detroit to work on the processing of car assembling and tooling. Roush had always been fascinated with engines and was determined to work in that area. He then went on to obtain a Master?s Degree in Scientific Mathematics from Eastern Michigan University in 1970, which he felt was needed in order to move into the engine research and development area.<br/><br/>While working for Ford, Roush was drawn to the company?s extensive motorsports activities. Always the organizer, he soon surrounded himself with others who shared his enthusiasm for going fast in a drag racer. Roush joined a group called \"The Fastbacks\" in 1966. <br/><br/>Working for Ford provided steady income, but security and professional accomplishments were no substitute for going faster than the last time, and faster than anybody else at the racetrack. Roush left Ford in May of 1969 and began buying his own equipment to improve the racing performance of \"The Fastbacks.\" It was not long before he was doing development work for other teams.<br/><br/>Roush worked at Chrysler as an engineer for one year before leaving in 1970 to start his own engineering business. As \"The Fastbacks\" disbanded that year, Roush began his next venture into racing by forming a partnership with Wayne Gapp. For the next five years, the duo attracted national attention by winning events and one championship each in NHRA, IHRA and AHRA with their Pro Stock racer.<br/><br/>Roush also spent some time teaching in between his racing ventures. He taught mathematics, physics and a variety of automotive subjects at Monroe Community College in Monroe, Mich., in 1971 and 1972.<br/><br/>Roush was involved exclusively in drag racing until 1978, and advanced in power classes to the NHRA Pro Stock division. He also managed to find time to provide engines for race teams in other sports, such as the Pike?s Peak Hill Climb and various powerboat and oval track series. <br/><br/>In 1976, Roush ended his partnership with Gapp and formed Jack Roush Performance Engineering. Roush?s success at the track and his reputation as a performance engineer helped deliver project after project to his doorstep. He stopped operating the drag racing team, but kept doing race business for other teams. Roush primarily built engines for other teams throughout the early 1980?s.<br/><br/>In 1982 Roush formed a partnership with Zakspeed Racing to run GTX and GTP cars for Ford in the United States. Zakspeed had much success racing in Europe and wanted to partner with Roush for the US races. Some of their drivers included Kevin Cogan, Bobby Rahal and European superstar Klaus Ludwig.<br/><br/>In 1984, Roush returned to competition in the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) road racing series and a legend was born. In the first year, he won the manufacturer's title for Lincoln-Mercury. Since then, Roush Racing has claimed 24 national championships and titles in the two series, including 12 manufacturer?s championships. Some of the drivers who helped Roush achieve his 119 road racing victories are Tommy Kendall, Wally Dallenbach, Jr., Scott Pruett, Willy T. Ribbs and former Craftsman Truck team general manager, Max Jones.<br/><br/>Roush has also earned 10 consecutive 24 Hours of Daytona sedan class championships. Some of the drivers who competed for Roush are Kendall, Dallenbach, Pruett, Mark Martin, Bill Elliott, Ricky Rudd, Kyle Petty, Ken Schrader, Robby Gordon, Pete Halsmer, Lyn St. James, as well as actor Paul Newman and Olympian Bruce Jenner.<br/><br/>In 1988, Roush moved south and expanded his racing business to include a NASCAR Winston Cup team with driver Mark Martin. During the team?s inaugural season, Martin won one pole and earned 10 top-10 finishes. In October 1989, Roush and Martin claimed their first NASCAR Winston Cup victory at North Carolina Motor Speedway.<br/><br/>Today, Roush has expanded his racing operations to include five Nextel Cup teams, one full season and two limited-schedule Busch Series teams and two Craftsman Truck Series teams. In October of 2004, Roush earned his 300th career win in the post-drag racing era as a team owner with Kenseth?s Busch victory at Atlanta Motor Speedway. His engine facilities in Livonia, Mich., and Mooresville, N.C., also supply the horsepower for several other teams in Nextel Cup and Busch Series racing, including Wood Brothers Racing. </div> "}, "id": "KQG6WBGLGLAHAKCI"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/georgia/cabbage-patch-kids", "City": "Test", "Name": "Cabbage Patch Kids", "Longitude": -83.760476, "State/Province": "Georgia", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 34.596612, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Clothing and Textiles", "Description": " Known the world over as the birthplace of the \"hand-stitched\" Original Cabbage Patch Kids, BabyLand General Hospital is a very real place.<br/><br/>Our History:<br/><br/>1976<br/>As a 21 year old art student, Xavier Roberts rediscovers \"needle molding\" a German technique for fabric sculpture from the early 1800?s.

When Cross Keys Village changed to a retail center, an old pretzel company from Lancaster agreed to move their factory to the complex, as an anchor for the property. The building was renovated, but in the meantime, the folks changed their minds! <br/><br/>As a theme designer for restaurants, Donna Clark developed themes and then found a tenant for properties. At the Cross Keys Village Center, the product (handmade pretzels) and the concept (a working pretzel factory) were intriguing to Donna, so she decided to start the Pretzel Factory herself! It was something new for Donna, but after five years, she's glad she made the move to open the Intercourse Pretzel Factory! <br/>Recipes are part of the theme of a restaurant and Donna decided to create some recipes of her own for the Intercourse Pretzel Factory. After some experimentation, she came up with the idea of a stuffed pretzel. A soft pretzel dough, wrapped around the very best foods unique to the Lancaster County Pennsylvania Dutch culture. Jellies with cream cheese, sweet smoked bologna and onion relish, or sausage and sauerkraut--to name a few favorites.<br/><br/>Intercourse Pretzel Factory touches on a little corner of Lancaster County Heritage--everyone around here eats hard pretzels! Better than store bought, the hand-twisted hard pretzels are available in bags or gift tins. Sample the plain, cheese, herb or brown butter pretzels. (As far as we know, Intercourse Pretzel Factory is the only place where you can get a brown butter or herb hard pretzel!)<br/><br/>You can also enjoy a plain, traditional soft pretzel at Intercourse Pretzel Factory. They are a favorite for those who believe simple is the best, but if not... Chocolate covered pretzels are for you! Big pretzels coated with Wilbur's premium grade chocolate. Some have peanut butter chips, but all are favorites!<br/><br/>Unique to Intercourse Pretzel Factory is the delicious Molasses Caramel Crunch--Pretzels, popcorn and peanuts coated with a molasses and butter caramel. And, you can also enjoy specialty coffees and hand-dipped Coleman's ice cream.<br/><br/>As she worked with the concept for Intercourse Pretzel Factory, Donna found that one thing lead to another, and another, and ... The store is an eclectic mix, from pretzels to antiques to bulk spices. You'll see and remember things from yesterdays! The antiques amuse people as they remember things from when they were young and spend more time looking around than anything else, but Donna is happy about that. She wanted the store to be about memories and heritage, and it surely is a reminder of our Lancaster County Heritage. </div> "}, "id": "KXUA850GHH3GCMCM"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/pennsylvania/perrydell-dairy-farm", "City": "Test", "Name": "Perrydell Dairy Farm", "Longitude": -76.719763, "State/Province": "Pennsylvania", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 39.911626, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " We are a 3rd generation family dairy farm.

One day, a hobo hopped from a train about a half block from the stone building and followed his nose to the bread bakery. He was looking for a job and something to eat. Sturgis couldn?t offer the man a job, but he extended his hospitality and invited the hobo to sit down at the family dinner table. In exchange for the kindness, the hobo gave Julius a pretzel recipe and an institution was born. <br/><br/>In 1861, eleven years after he baked the first pretzel, Julius stopped making bread and became the first commercial pretzel bakery in America.<br/><br/>Today, visitors get a tour of the pretzel factory and a chance to roll their own pretzels and take a few home with them. </div> "}, "id": "MJ47Q16JJZGAU0O9"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/sprecher-brewing-co", "City": "Test", "Name": "Sprecher Brewing Co", "Longitude": -87.919496, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 43.100021, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Start your tour in our Rathskellar Museum where you can view brewing memorabilia from long gone Wisconsin breweries while waiting for your tour to begin.

Graham Dunn is a family owned and operated business that opened its doors in 1976. However the series of events that lead to this business began much earlier. It?s difficult to pick a time or place to begin, but we will try to do just that. The time is the 1940?s and the place is a politically unstable China.<br/><br/>Peter Dunn?s parents, Marvin and Miriam Dunn, dedicated nearly their entire lives to work in China serving China Inland Missions, a mission founded by Hudson Taylor. Each began serving independently, and it was in China that they met and were married. Miriam kept a memoir of her experiences as a child of missionaries growing up in China herself. It is Peter?s goal to one day have these memories published and shared. Marvin and Miriam continued serving until their retirement in 1973.<br/><br/>During World War II, Marvin and Miriam were serving in a small village helping a young couple prepare for their wedding ceremony. Unfortunately due to the war, the bride was having difficulty obtaining silk for her wedding dress. Eventually some silk was rounded up for the dress from a most unusual source. The wedding dress was made from silk parachutes of American aviators who had just finished a near suicide mission over Japan. The man in charge of the operation was none other than Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle.<br/><br/>China was a very turbulent and dangerous place in the 40?s and 50?s for foreigners. In 1944 Mr. and Mrs. Graham Hutchinson were led to join the China Inland Mission. During these years of service, Japan invaded China and the invasion was followed by intense civil war. This put the lives of missionaries at risk. The mission board ordered the evacuation of all who were serving in southwestern China. This included the Graham Hutchinson?s and also Marvin and Miriam Dunn. The route to safety was a bumpy flight on a DC-3 over the Himalayas into India. The Graham Hutchinson?s were scheduled to fly out on the same plane as the Dunn?s. However, the plane ran out of seating before everyone was loaded. The childless Hutchinson?s noticed that Miriam was obviously pregnant and had not been seated. They voluntarily gave up their seats so Miriam and Marvin could take the first flight out of China. After arriving safely in India, Miriam and Marvin were devastated to learn the following flight crashed into the Himalayas and everyone on board perished.<br/><br/>Miriam gave birth to Peter?s older sister Rosemary in India. After returning to China less than two years later to resume their work, Miriam gave birth to a son. She named him Peter Graham Dunn in recognition of the sacrifice the Graham Hutchinson?s made. Later when Peter chose a name for his new business, it was important to emphasize Graham. Finally, when Peter and his wife LeAnna had their son Thomas, they extended this recognition by naming him Thomas Graham Dunn.<br/><br/>Peter?s journey from China to the world?s largest Amish and Mennonite community took him through Three Hills, Alberta. It was there while Peter was a young man that he spotted the young lady who would later become his wife, LeAnna Gerber, a Mennonite from the United States. Peter courted LeAnna for nearly 7 years, never seeming to gain her affection. While nearly ready to give up, Peter traveled to Ohio to visit LeAnna and her family over the Christmas holidays of 1971. Sitting atop the silo on the family farm, LeAnna turned to Peter and asked if he was going to ask to marry her, or what! And marry her he did.<br/><br/>In 1972, newlyweds Peter and LeAnna Dunn accepted a mission from their church to open a home for runaway girls in New York City. In order to keep the girls occupied, they initiated a small woodworking business. The girls carved plaques and gifts that quickly became popular items at out-door markets in Greenwich Village. When the mission in New York was complete, the couple bought the woodworking equipment and installed it on their farm in Dalton, Ohio.<br/><br/>Peter spent the next two years building silos for area farmers to support his family, while perfecting his designs and manufacturing techniques during every spare moment. In 1977, he received an order for 3,000 items, allowing him to devote all his energies to his growing business. For the next twenty years, he designed every plaque, gift and each item of furniture. Today, a diverse group of employees contributes to the design process, resulting in a healthier company and broader market appeal.<br/>In the early days, the work was labor-intensive. In time, the company began to computerize carving and laser operations and found it could compete successfully with offshore manufacturers. Today P. Graham Dunn serves over 4,000 accounts, most in the U.S., and the remainder in Canada and around the world.<br/><br/>P. Graham Dunn is located in Dalton, Ohio operating in a 140,000 square foot manufacturing facility. Inside the facility is an 18,000 square foot retail store and viewing gallery. Guests enter the massive two-story lobby where oversized plaques adorn the walls, scripture is carved into the crown molding, and where they?ll find one of Ohio?s largest indoor murals. Ascending to the second floor store, windows along each side give visitors a bird?s eye view of the production process from start to finish. Lasers in the store are available for custom engraved gifts on the spot. Additionally services are available to bring your own custom ideas to life. And if that wasn?t enough bargain shoppers flock to the Factory Outlet where we constantly add overstocked, scratch &amp; dent, prototype, discontinued, and unfinished merchandise. <br/><br/>P. Graham Dunn opened two stores in Gatlinburg, TN, a store in Branson, MO, Walnut Creek, OH, and in Crocker Park in Westlake, OH. <br/><br/>While much has changed at P. Graham Dunn over the past thirty years, much remains the same. The first two employees of the company are still active in the business. Robert Shetler is vice president of manufacturing and Carol Currie who works in the shipping department. While Peter?s wife LeAnna no longer manages the finances for the business, she actively helps choose all the scripture engraved on the prints. Peter?s son, Paul, does much of the product design and custom work and his son-in-law Joe Knutson is the retail operations manager.<br/><br/>While we strive to ensure P. Graham Dunn is successful in a competitive manufacturing environment, we will never lose sight of the sacrifice the Graham Hutchinson?s made, for the service Peter?s parents contributed to China, and ultimately our mission to Lift Him Up.<br/> </div> "}, "id": "N8LLQNXOP3S3PHQV"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/vermont/otter-creek-brewing", "City": "Test", "Name": "Otter Creek Brewing", "Longitude": -73.170821, "State/Province": "Vermont", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 44.032317, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Located in beautiful Middlebury, Vermont, we shipped our first keg of Copper Ale in March of 1991.

We are committed to finding the best coffees from around the world, for a fair price. Those beans are then roasted using a convection air-roasting method, instead of the more traditional drum-roasting method, to ensure superior consistency and a tastier, smoother cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Quality, freshness, education. That's what The Roasterie is about. Try any of our coffees and you'll be able to taste and smell the difference our commitment makes.<br/><br/><br/>The Roasterie Caf\u00e9 <br/>==================<br/>In 2005, The Roasterie Caf\u00e9 was opened in Brookside.

Henry was a master cabinet maker who built his first piano in the kitchen of his Seesen, Germany home. By the time Henry established Steinway &amp; Sons, he had built 482 pianos. The first piano produced by the company, number 483, was sold to a New York family for $500. It is now displayed at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br/><br/>Over the next forty years, Henry and his sons, Henry Jr., Albert, C.F. Theodore, William, and Charles, developed the modern piano. Almost half of the company's 114 patented inventions were developed during this period. Many of these late nineteenth-century inventions were based on emerging scientific research, including the acoustical theories of the renowned physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.<br/><br/>Steinway's revolutionary designs and superior workmanship began receiving national recognition almost immediately. Starting in 1855, Steinway pianos received gold medals at several U.S. and European exhibitions. The company gained international recognition in 1867 at the Paris Exhibition when it was awarded the prestigious \"Grand Gold Medal of Honor\" for excellence in manufacturing and engineering. It was the first time an American company had received this award. Steinway pianos quickly became the piano of choice for many members of royalty and won the respect and admiration of the world's great pianists.<br/><br/>In 1866 Steinway &amp; Sons opened the first Steinway Hall on 14th Street. With a main auditorium of 2,000 seats, it became New York City's artistic and cultural center, housing the New York Philharmonic until Carnegie Hall opened in 1891. By this time, the company had moved to its current location in the Astoria section of Queens, New York, and built Steinway Village. Virtually its own town, Steinway Village had its own foundries, factory, post office, parks and housing for employees.<br/><br/>In 1871, Henry Sr. died and sons C.F. Theodore and William took over operations. An accomplished pianist, C.F. Theodore was responsible for the technical aspects of piano making and personally earned the company 41 patents, including one in 1875 for the modern concert grand piano. In the same year, William helped establish a showroom in London. Five years later, in 1880, the Hamburg factory began operating and a retail operation, the Steinway-Haus, was established. Another retail operation opened in Berlin in 1909.<br/><br/>Today, Steinway &amp; Sons crafts approximately 5,000 pianos a year worldwide. Over 1300 prominent concert artists and ensembles across the world bear the title Steinway Artist. No artist or ensemble is a paid endorser of the piano. Each Steinway Artist personally owns a Steinway and has chosen to perform on the Steinway piano professionally. In North America, artists select their Steinway for concert performances from the company's unique \"piano bank,\" an inventory of more than 300 pianos valued at over $15 million. <br/><br/>Pianos are placed throughout North America and are maintained to concert standards by an exclusive network of Steinway dealers. The famed \"basement\" of New York's Steinway Hall, at 109 West 57th Street in New York City, is the bank's home office. Branch piano banks are maintained at Steinway dealerships in cities throughout the country to serve performing artists. In all other countries, major concert venues in each town own Steinway &amp; Sons instruments which the artist can use. </div> "}, "id": "NVKQ74D2DYV0U0D3"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/tennessee/jack-daniel-distillery", "City": "Test", "Name": "Jack Daniel Distillery", "Longitude": -86.357478, "State/Province": "Tennessee", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.318047, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " The historic Jack Daniel Distillery is the major claim to fame of tiny (pop. 361) Lynchburg.

Aviat is engaged in the development, manufacture and servicing of sport and utility aircraft sold under the trade names of Husky A-1A and A-1B, the Pitts Special S-2C, and the Eagle II. The facility, situated two blocks south of the city center, consists primarily of six light manufacturing buildings containing approximately 72,000 square feet of enclosed space on about five acres of land in a 47 acre parcel.<br/><br/>The facility at Afton has many advantages as a manufacturing base including the availability of labor that has many years experience in the construction of light aircraft.<br/><br/>The Pitts Special is part of American aviation history. An early Pitts Special airplane is in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. Pitts Special airplanes are also in the Experimental Aviation Association Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin as well as the British Museum in London and many other aviation museums around the world.<br/><br/>The Pitts Special was designed by Curtis Pitts and is acknowledged as the worlds leading competition aerobatic and airshow display airplane. The Pitts Special has won more aerobatic competitions than any other airplane in history. It is the only fully FAA Certified competition airplane made in America and one of the very few which are manufactured in the world.<br/><br/>The current model is the Pitts S-2C, a two-place airplane capable of unlimited category competition and universally recognized as \"the\" aerobatic trainer, as it can legally carry both instructor and student, including fuel reserves, during all hard aerobatic training sessions. There have been some 700 factory manufactured Pitts and an estimated 600 that have been built from plans or kits in the period before 1984.<br/><br/>The Husky, conceptually based on the world famous Super Cub, is a completely new design, created in 1986 and fully certified in 1987. It was designed to do all the things that the Cub pilot used to say, \"I wish it would do that!!!\" - In other words an improvement on the world's favorite airplane. Over 650 have now been made and are in use all over the world. The Husky is fully FAA certificated and is in use throughout Canada, Australia, South Africa, all major European countries, Asia, and several South American countries. Used as an observation platform by law enforcement agencies, power and gas companies, environmental protection agencies and many others, it also is proven to have the power to be a very effective glider tug or to be used for banner towing, apart from being used as just a fun airplane for the sheer joy of flying.<br/><br/>This is the famous homebuilt kit of a very similar design to the Pitts, which was created by Frank Christensen. The Eagle also formed the famous \"Eagles Flight Team\" which was the longest continuous airshow team in the United States, running for 25 years. Famed as one of the most comprehensive and best kits of all time, the Eagle comes complete with 32 manuals (one for each kit subsection) that have been designed to lead the novice builder smoothly through the process of building his own airplane.<br/><br/>The company does not need to rely solely on the sale of new aircraft for its revenue. A customer service provides service work for our machines, both homebuilt and factory built. Aircraft owners often prefer their airplane to be maintained by the factory due to its specialist nature. This growing area of the operation provides services ranging from annual inspection to complete rebuild and refurbishment or restoration. </div> "}, "id": "O9UW3S6V0OO650OE"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/vermont/lake-champlain-chocolates", "City": "Test", "Name": "Lake Champlain Chocolates", "Longitude": -73.214206, "State/Province": "Vermont", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 44.458856, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Lake Champlain Chocolates started on a dare.<br/>In 1983, Jim Lampman, owner of Burlington, Vermont's acclaimed Ice House Restaurant on the Lake Champlain waterfront, was buying expensive boxes of chocolates as gifts for his staff.

Jim began serving them Sundays to select restaurant patrons. The response was so favorable, Jim founded an upscale chocolate company to keep up with the demand. <br/><br/>Although intended only for wholesale, and located in a tiny alley, the business was constantly interrupted by retail customers who somehow found out which door to knock on to get the locally famous truffles.

The Argus reported on May 13, 1926, \"Nothing like it has ever been constructed before...the theatrical world is setting back astounded.\"<br/><br/>The Lincoln is what's called a period theater, which were in vogue around the time it was built. Some theaters built in the twenties had an Egyptian motif; one Seattle theater had a Chinese motif, but the Lincoln was a little different for the Northwest; it had a Spanish motif.<br/><br/>Manager Edwin Halberg ignored the pleas of his friends that he follow the crowd and make it Egyptian. He foresaw a time when movie fans would tire of such a motif. He personally designed the luxurious carpet, the decorative effect on the walls, the hangings and draperies, and the lighting effects.<br/><br/>The primary colors were blue, yellow, and red. The foyer was lighted with quaint, wrought-iron patterns of Spanish design. The walls have what's known as a travertine finish.<br/><br/>Of the 98 Wurlitzer organs remaining in their original theaters in the U.S., the Lincoln Theatre?s Wurlitzer is one of only two 2-manual, 7-rank D-2 Full Unit Orchestra models. It has a full set of organ pipes, as well as a set of ?toys,? the mechanical sound effects for silent movies, as well as marimbas, drums, glockenspiel, xylophone, cathedral chimes, celeste, etc., and an original Wurlitzer piano.<br/><br/>The Lincoln Wurlitzer features seven ranks of pipes, a remote piano, and a complete sound effect system for silent films, including beats, castanets, drums, cymbals, glockenspiels, and marimbas, as well as a set of silver chimes mounted on the auditorium's painted columns.<br/><br/>Much work has been done by our pool of volunteer organists and technicians to maintain and repair our musical treasure.<br/><br/>The console has been pulled, cleaned, and rewired; several ranks have been gone through, with new leathers and blocks installed; and the \"toy box\" for sound effects has been rearranged for easier access and repair.

Artists and photgraphers have captured the building's sweeping curves and geometric designs on canvas and film. And thousands of people have delighted in the spectacular \"bird-cage\" elevators. What began as a new office building for SC Johnson Wax has become a testament to the foresight of H. F. Johnson, Jr. and the vision of Frank Lloyd Wright. The feeling was shared by LIFE magazine when it compared the 1939 World's Fair and the SC Johnson Wax building: \"Future historians may well decide that a truer glimpse of the shape of things to come than is represented by the New York World's Fair was given in a single structure built strictly for business - the Administration Building of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., in Racine, Wisconsin.\" <br/><br/>Wright decided the Administration Center to be a functional building. He studied the daily work flow and believed that the most important criteria for his designs were the people. Wright also considered the corporate hierarchy. The clerical staff had office areas on the main level, the manager's offices were on the mezzanine level surrounding the clerical staff, and the executive offices on the third or Penthouse level, over-seeing everyone below. <br/><br/>The Great Workroom, which covers nearly one-half acre, is the main office area. Though it has many unique features, two of the most prominent are the slim, dendriform columns which support the roof and the glass tubing which replaces conventional windows. Neither of these features had been used before. <br/><br/>The bricks used in the building are also unusual. More than 200 sizes and shapes of bricks were made to form the angles and curves used by Wright. Even their color, Cherokee Red, was specified by Wright. To complement the warm tone of the brick, a lighter colored Kasota stone was used as trim. And to continue Wright's idea of fluidity and movement, the mortar in the horizontal brick joints was recessed or raked out. <br/><br/>Johnson's interest in Frank Lloyd Wright continued and in 1947 construction began on the Research and Development Tower. The 14-floor tower is one of the tallest structures ever built where there is no visible support under the outer walls. Wright designed the Tower using the cantilever principle which is similar to the root, trunk and branch system of a tree. This design allows the tower to appear to hang, suspended in the air. The interior levels alternate round and square floor levels. Wright's intention was to allow for easy communication between floors via the \"open corners.\" The architect again used glass tubing instead of windows to allow for even, shadowless light and to prevent any view of outside distractions. <br/><br/>Connecting the Administration Center to the Research Tower, is a Wright designed bridge, enclosed completely by plate glass and glass tubing. And to further ensure the comfort of the employees in the cold Wisconsin winters, he also created a system of interconnected, underground tunnels to access each building. <br/><br/>The genius of Wright did not stop with the design of the building. He also designed the furniture, again, to complement the work flow and needs of the employees. The now-famous three-leg chairs prompted good posture. <br/><br/>Although by architectural standards the SC Johnson Wax Administration Center and Research Tower are relatively new, it is the intent of the company to maintain the buildings' integrity throughout the years. In 1976 the Administration Center and Research Tower, along with their companion buildings, were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This classification assures future generations that they will be able to see the buildings as close to their original form as possible. </div> "}, "id": "OP80PXMEYKAYM9XZ"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/kentucky/buffalo-trace-distillery", "City": "Test", "Name": "Buffalo Trace Distillery", "Longitude": -84.868363, "State/Province": "Kentucky", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 38.212669, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Buffalo Trace Distillery is located in Franklin County, Kentucky, at an ancient buffalo crossing that became a pathway for westward moving explorers, pioneers and settlers. The bold spirit of Kentucky's ancestors lives on at Buffalo Trace Distillery, which stands as one of America's oldest distilling sites. The site's rugged flavor has been preserved for the benefit of Kentuckians, guests and visitors. The Buffalo Trace Distillery invites you to come and experience Buffalo Trace and feel the soul of adventure that is it legacy. <br/><br/>In 1775 the Leestown settlement was established when brothers Hancock and <br/>Courtesy Buffalo Trace Distillery Willis Lee established their camp with a small company of men. They struggled to survive in the unforgiving conditions of a fierce wilderness and by 1789 the area held a thriving population. The abundant limestone spring water and fertile bottom loam-found to be perfect for growing exceptional grain, gave way to distillation and the distinguished bourbon heritage took root. There has been a working distillery on the grounds since 1787. The first modern distillery was built on the site in 1857, the first U.S. distillery to incorporate the use of steam power. E. H. Taylor, Jr., one of Kentucky's original bourbon aristocrats, purchased the site. By 1886, the distillery had introduced the nation's first climate-controlled warehousing for aging whiskey and earned a world-wide reputation for producing America's finest bourbon. Albert Blanton took over the operation and in 1984 the distillery became the first to commercially market a single-barrel bourbon. <br/><br/>The distillery has a history of finely crafted, award-winning bourbons. In the last 10 years alone, Buffalo Trace bourbons have earned more than 40 top distinctions in national and international competitions, and is world renowned. Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is the distillery's namesake spirit. Made in celebration of the area's rich ancestral heritage, the bourbon embodies the bold and rugged soul of early America. <br/><br/>The Elmer T. Lee Clubhouse was constructed some 60 years ago, with 200-year-old logs from authentic Kentucky log cabins. The two-story building can accommodate groups from 30 to 250, a private bar area is available year round and the facility is equipped with a full kitchen. The rustic veranda and balcony overlook a tree-shaded courtyard and floral gardens. The grounds are complete with an ornamental stream and a quaint wooden bridge. The perfect setting for private parties, receptions, business meetings and conferences. Tours of the distillery include: a visit to the distillery museum, the viewing of a historic film, a walk through the century-old warehouse, touring the bottling facilities and a stop at the gift shop. </div> "}, "id": "OPVKRZILKEO9W2R1"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/michigan/chelsea-teddy-bear-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Chelsea Teddy Bear Company", "Longitude": -84.0204095, "State/Province": "Michigan", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 42.3201601, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Clothing and Textiles", "Description": " What does one hundred thousand teddy bears look like...<br/><br/>Well come and see 100,000 teddy bears in our 35,000 sq./ft. warehouse and production facility located in the historic Clock Tower Complex, in downtown Chelsea, Michigan. <br/><br/><br/>FACTORY TOURS<br/>Tours will be open to the public on Saturdays at the following times:<br/>11:00 a.m.<br/>1:00 p.m.<br/>3:00 p.m.<br/>Private group tours may be scheduled for any day Monday through Saturday. </div> "}, "id": "OXS3FCHROTLM5MCF"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/texas/papes-pecan-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Pape's Pecan Company", "Longitude": -97.970147, "State/Province": "Texas", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 29.60592, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Tour the facility, pecan orchard, and collection of more than 3,000 antique pecan crackers.

Bill Braum was in grade school when he began his career by helping his father, Henry H. Braum, with the family business, a small butter and milk processing plant in Emporia, Kansas. Seven years later ice cream processing was added to the operation.<br/><br/>Bill Braum worked through high school with his father and after receiving a degree in Business Administration from the University of Kansas in 1949, he came back to Emporia to take a more active role in the family business. Henry Braum sold the wholesale part of the business in 1952 and began specializing in ice cream, developing a chain of retail ice cream stores in Kansas called \"Peter Pan.\" In 1957 he purchased the company from his father. The company had approximately 61 retail stores, when in 1967, a large wholesaler bought the \"Peter Pan\" chain of retail stores (excluding the Braum dairy herd and processing plant) As a condition of the sale, the Braum's would not be allowed to sell ice cream in the State of Kansas for ten years.<br/><br/>In 1968, Bill and his wife Mary, started a new chain of retail stores in Oklahoma called BRAUM'S ICE CREAM AND DAIRY STORES. That first year, twenty-four stores were opened in Oklahoma. Because the Braum dairy herd and processing plant were still located in Emporia, Kansas, the ice cream, dairy products and other supplies had to be transported daily from Emporia, Kansas to Oklahoma. For three years, Braum's stores were serviced from the plant in Emporia until a new processing plant was built in Oklahoma City in 1971.<br/><br/>In 1975, the Braum dairy herd was moved from Emporia to its new home located in Tuttle, Oklahoma. Today, Braum's owns seven farms and ranches, totaling over 40,000 acres (62 square miles) of some of the best farm and ranch land in America! Each plays its own unique role in the Braum operation from housing the Braum cows, to growing the alfalfa hay to feed the dairy herd.<br/><br/>Braum's bakery was built in Oklahoma City in 1978. This facility now produces the fresh bakery items available in the Braum's stores including cookies, cones, buns, breads and much more.<br/><br/>As the company grew, the need for a bigger processing plant became evident. In 1987, Braum's construction crews built a 260,000 square foot, state-of-the-art processing plant on the Braum farm in Tuttle. Located only minutes from the milking operation, this plant enables Braum's to consistently control the freshness, purity and quality of their products.<br/><br/>In 1993, Braum's construction crews built a new milking complex on the Tuttle farm. This complex consists of 17 freestall barns (over 35 acres) that house the milking herd and a milking parlor, which is the largest of its kind in the world! Three times a day, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, Braum's is milking 10,000 cows! Today, Braum's is still the only major ice cream maker in the country that milks its own cows. <br/><br/>Braum's is unique in the dairy industry because it is vertically integrated. Braum's \"cuts out the middleman\" by owning its dairy herd, farms and ranches, processing plant, bakery, retail stores and delivery trucks. Braum's can offer its customers the highest quality products at the lowest possible prices.<br/><br/>Today, there are over 280 Braum's Ice Cream and Dairy Stores throughout Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Missouri and Arkansas. The company remains family owned and operated. </div> "}, "id": "P32SP8X2U4NR414Y"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/wisconsin-wagon-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Wisconsin Wagon Company", "Longitude": -89.0303401, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 42.6820158, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Early Years: In 1915, \"Wisconsin Carriage Company,\" who had the reputation for building quality buggies, carriages, sleights and cutters realized that the introduction of the automobile was adversely affecting their historic business. So they put their efforts into the design and manufacturing of coaster wagons, \"skudder\" cars and other sidewalk toys. It was at this time the company decided to name this spinoff group \"Janesville Products Company\". Their toys were sold by the thousands and gained a nationwide reputation. Toys were advertised regularly in such national publications as the \"Saturday Evening Post\". <br/><br/>Early Coaster wagons featured ball bearing spoked wheels and nickel-plated dust caps. This \"speed-wagon\" also sported a seldom-used brake. The body of the wagon was made with select white ash and was offer in three sizes. Prices for a Coaster wagon in the 30's ranged from ten to twelve dollars. Several of the original wagons remain in use today; many are reportedly in demand as collectors' items.<br/><br/>The Janesville Coaster was advertised as the wagon that \"has more speed, gives the boys more fun. Keeps them out in the open, builds strong, nimble bodies and quick-acting minds. Runs so easily it make play of hauling heavy loads of groceries, coal wood, ice, milk cans, etc.\"<br/><br/>But the depression hit and although \"Janesville Products\" attempted to build a less expensive wagon, and even produced a prototype of a pinball machine, the factory closed in 1940.<br/><br/>A new generation: In 1978 a retired businessman seeking a special gift, a wooden wagon, for his first grandson, realized that the Janesville coaster wagon that he remembered so fondly and treasured as a child was no longer being produced. Armed with a sketchpad he went to the community Historical Society and sketched an authentic Janesville wagon that was on display. He then dissected the remains of an original wagon discovered in a friend's garage and from those remains and sketches, built what was to become the first \"Wisconsin Wagon Company's\" Janesville Coaster Wagon. <br/><br/>The Series II is a detailed replica in design and construction, it incorporates all of the features that made the original so popular. Material changes with the current wagons consist of using solid red oak and stainless steel hardware. But ball-bearing wheels, our trademark, has been continued to enable our wagon to roll smoothly though the years. Each is registered and has a numbered nameplate under the dashboard so future generations can determine the age of their heirloom.<br/><br/>Though the years our collection of wagons have grown. We currently produce four different size wagons. From our tiny Tag-a-long to the heavy duty Islander Goods wagon all of our wagons are hand built with pride. </div> "}, "id": "P41FA13CBB71T3B7"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/california/silvercrest-homes-corona-ca", "City": "Test", "Name": "Silvercrest Homes (Corona, CA)", "Longitude": -117.592682, "State/Province": "California", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 33.88859, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Silvercrest Online was designed especially with YOU in mind.

They are immediately \"graded\", that is, sorted into seven sizes. From there most will go to tanks for curing.

We're best known for our many varieties of processed pickles.<br/><br/>Those cucumbers that don't go immediately to the tanks become \"fresh pack\" pickles. These are washed, usually cut, packed and pasteurized. They can be eaten within three or four days of being packed.

All of our products labeled \"sweet\" or \"candied\" have been through this process, the candied having been sweetened twice.

The photograph, mined from the depths of an old cardboard box filled with dusty memorabilia, depicts the original Taylor shop on its very first day of existence -- October 15, 1974. <br/><br/>On the left, pony-tailed, 22-year-old employee Tim Luranc is examining something, while then-part-owner Steve Schemmer shovels water from the floor into a bucket. A companion photo shows the adjoining room on the same day. Crude, garish, overhead lights illuminate a funky old refrigerator amid indistinguishable clutter; a \"humidity-controlled\" booth with plastic-film walls; and a rough concrete floor pocked with puddles of standing water and clumps of soggy sawdust. \"Primitive\" and \"wet\" aptly describe both scenes. <br/> <br/>In Taylor's early days, the morning after a rainstorm frequently began with cleaning up pools of water and soggy sawdust caused by flooding. <br/>\"That place was so bad,\" Listug recalls, shaking his head. \"The roof leaked like crazy, and whenever it rained, the place flooded. It rained hard the night before we opened, so we spent the entire morning of our first day in business trying to get as much water out of there as we could.\"<br/><br/>\"See those clumps of wet sawdust? When it flooded, we'd take all the sawdust that we'd already swept up, and sprinkle it around the floor to soak up the water. It made the place even more of a pig sty,\" he says, laughing. \"But it was fun. What did we know? We were just kids. Somehow, we'd skirted having to get real jobs. We didn't have a boss, we were making guitars. What could be better?\" <br/><br/>Despite the semi-aquatic conditions and inauspicious circumstances of Taylor's first few days of life, Listug's voice betrays a genuine wistfulness as he recalls the \"hungry years\" that made it possible for the company to be celebrating its 25th Anniversary in 1999. Listug enjoys reminiscing about the long, painstaking process of co-shepherding Taylor Guitars from its humble, naive beginnings to its current status as one of the world's most successful and highly regarded acoustic guitar manufacturers. <br/><br/>In one respect, there is no escaping the company's history, thanks to numerous human and material reminders of the company's scuffling days that can be found throughout Taylor's modern, high-tech facility. Primary among these, of course, are Taylor and Listug, who have made musical-instrument history by becoming the first American luthiers in this century to take an acoustic guitar company from one-off shop to production-level manufacturer without relinquishing ownership or creative control. Other first-decade Taylorites who are either still on the job, or who have left and come back, include Luranc (profiled in the Summer 1994 issue of our quarterly newsletter, Wood&amp;Steel), Steve Baldwin (1983--), and Bob Zink (1984--profiled in the Fall '98 issue). <br/><br/>Among significant relics are a few early-vintage Taylor guitars that have been re-acquired over the years, and which repose in a safe place known only to Bob Taylor. Several tidy binders and scrapbooks on file in the current building's conference room contain articles and advertisements that delineate Taylor's progress from baby steps to leaps. Still, it's the cardboard box that provides Taylor and Listug their best opportunity to relish the sometimes poignant, often hilarious chronicles of the firm's first two decades. Looking at photographs of the duo as long-haired, bearded teenagers, Listug effortlessly spins anecdotes, punctuating his commentary with frequent, almost reflexive chuckling. <br/><br/>\"I remember, as a teenager, driving with my parents past this guitar-repair shop called the Blue Guitar, in the Old Town area of San Diego,\" he said. \"I thought guitars were the coolest thing, and I couldn't imagine anything cooler than working on them for a living. So, I pestered Sam Radding, owner of the American Dream shop in Lemon Grove, to hire me, even though I didn't have any of the necessary skills. Eventually, a work bench opened up, and I quit my job painting buildings at San Diego State University and started doing finishing work. That was in August 1973. <br/><br/>\"A week or two later, Bob Taylor got a bench there. He'd been coming around for a while, buying guitar parts and showing Sam the guitars he'd made. At the time, Bob was 18 and I was 20.\" <br/><br/>In spite of his hirsute appearance, the young Taylor was quiet, reserved, and very \"straight,\" and, for a while, the rest of the American Dream employees more or less ignored him. One day, Bob abruptly put an end to that. <br/><br/>\"He came in where a few of us were eating lunch, sat down, and firmly announced, 'Well, I'm Bob Taylor,'\" Listug remembers. \"It was a real ice-breaker, and after that we all got along great.\" <br/> <br/>\"I remember being quite the odd duck in a real hippie shop,\" Taylor admits. \"My hair was a lot longer, and I had a beard, but otherwise I was just a clean-cut boy in a white t-shirt who went to church three times a week with his mom and dad and sister. My whole life experience up to that time was just being a 'good boy.' I'd never been in trouble in my life; I spent my time in school doing projects and getting straight A's, winning industrial-arts expositions. I didn't know what alcohol or drugs were. Still don't. Didn't know about college, or girls, or anything except tools, and working with things. And here I was, working with these kids who, compared to me, were partying, wise-to-the-world, guitar-building, hippie musicians. So, Kurt, Bob Huff, Michael Stewart, Steve Hilliard, Sam Radding, and Barbie Cousins -- they'd be off to the side, giggling at me.\" <br/>You might say that Taylor ended up at American Dream partly by default, partly by provident design. As a 17-year-old, he had seen a 12-string acoustic guitar in a local store window, and, lacking the funds to purchase it, had decided to make his own. He built three guitars while still in high school, working on them at night in the back of a service station, in between filling gas tanks and wiping windshields. Eventually, Taylor took his finished instruments to Sam Radding at American Dream. Radding was convinced that he had a future in the trade. <br/><br/>During their first year at American Dream, Taylor and Listug made a few guitars, but mostly did repairs. When Radding decided to sell the business in 1974, the employees split into rival purchasing groups of two, each team jockeying for position while trying to figure out how to come up with the requisite capital. Finally, a triumvirate of Taylor, Listug, and Schemmer bought the American Dream. Euphoric with ambition, they renamed it the Westland Music Company. <br/><br/>\"We thought that would sound impressive, and make people think we were bigger than we really were,\" Listug laughs. \"But Bob was the real guitar-maker, and, besides, we had to have a logo that would fit on the headstock, so we soon named the guitars Taylor guitars.\" <br/> <br/>By the time the fledgling company hoisted its new banner, Taylor and Listug had a pretty clear idea of how their guitars would differ from others on the market. Their first few instruments certainly functioned well enough, but they weren't exactly things of beauty. <br/><br/>\"Those first guitars had some structural problems, and sometimes the backs would ripple,\" Listug recalls. \"We knew they couldn't compete, aesthetically, with the best guitars on the market, so we just kept working at it until we had a marketable-looking guitar.\" <br/><br/>After selling a few prototypes at the workshop, the partners decided to take their wares directly to dealers. In 1976, Listug loaded some guitars into Bob Taylor's van and headed for the music stores in Los Angeles. \"They liked them, and I actually came home with checks in my hand,\" Listug says. <br/><br/>One of the first dealers to buy a Taylor guitar was the venerable McCabe's, in Santa Monica. John Zehnder, who today is the store's chief repairman, director of its music school, and banjo and mandolin instructor, remembers those first Taylors. <br/> <br/>\"In 1976, Taylors provided an affordable and viable alternative to Martins, which were the standard,\" Zehnder said in a phone interview. \"The Taylors' low-profile necks, and the fact that they offered several choices as to neck widths, were a real advantage. Plus, they sounded good, and, because of the way they were made [with bolt-on necks], we were able to make repairs instantly, which was greatly appreciated by our customers. In many ways, Taylor guitars were a real breath of fresh air.\" <br/><br/>Random acceptance, however, did not translate to across-the-board success. Wholesale receipts just barely enabled the luthiers to continue making guitars. <br/><br/>\"We got into this business just as the acoustic guitar market was going south in a big way,\" Taylor says. \"It was dying a cruel death. We first started trying to sell Taylor guitars at a time when Mossman, Gurian, and LoPrinzi [guitars] were just peaking, so every time Kurt would get to a store, another rep had just been there, and the dealer would say, 'Oh, we just took on the Mossman line. We don't have any money left.' <br/><br/>\"I remember one particularly bad day, clear as a bell,\" Taylor continues. \"It was Friday, the end of another work week. There was no money; we were so broke. It was a pretty depressing scene. Then, late in the day, this guy came into the shop. His name was Charlie See -- grandson of Martha See, founder of See's Candies. He ended up buying a guitar that was hanging on the wall, and ordered a Brazilian rosewood 815 with abalone on it. It was about 7:30 that evening by the time he left, and he wrote us a check for $1,873, which was like a hundred-thousand bucks to us! All of a sudden, we were back in business. We had enough money to pay that month's $163 rent and buy more supplies. We could make guitars for another week or two.\" <br/><br/>In 1977, Taylor Guitars linked up with a distributor in the hope of boosting sales. It would prove to be an unproductive move. <br/><br/>\"We ended up getting only $150 for a 510, $380 for an 855,\" Taylor recalls. \"That was a very unprofitable time, but it was a great learning time. It forced me to learn something about production techniques. I had to separate the chaff from the wheat -- what's important, what's not important. The main improvement was simply getting past a stupid mental barrier -- the notion that if you take a lot of time to accomplish a task, somehow it's better than accomplishing the same task, just as well, in less time. I'm glad I was very young when I learned that that notion just doesn't make sense.\" <br/><br/>Taylor and Listug ended their affiliation with the distributor in 1979, but for years, the company remained fixed at a plateau of making 10 guitars a week and not seeing a profit. Because they were unable to break into any new markets, newly finished guitars just lay, unsold, around the shop. Bills went unpaid. <br/><br/>\"We were really stupid,\" Listug recalls with a grin. \"We thought that if we simply made more guitars, we'd make more money. So, we'd hire extra people to turn out more instruments, and then we'd have to spend more time and money marketing the extra production. All we were doing was raising the overhead. And, without any capital to pay for expansion, we just dug ourselves a deeper hole of debt. Then, Bob got married, and one day he said, 'If I can't make a living at this, why am I doing it?'\" <br/><br/>\"Actually, by that time, I'd kind of mentally burned my bridges as far as doing anything else was concerned,\" Taylor allows. \"Every once in a while, people would ask me, 'Well, what if it just doesn't work out?' And I'd say, 'It has to work out.' I detested the thought of having to explain to everyone why I quit. That kept me going more than anything else -- the fear that for two years or more, I'd have to run into people who'd ask, 'What happened?' and I'd have to explain that we weren't doing well and had to give it up.\" <br/><br/>To save the business, the partners fired everyone and slowed production. In the short term, that enabled each of them to take home $100 per week -- enough to make ends meet. Gradually, they paid past-due bills and retired ancient debts. It was, to be sure, a meager living. <br/><br/>\"When we got to the point where we could take home $200 a week, I thought we were doing great,\" Listug says. \"I had a friend who was making $300 a week, and I remember thinking, 'Whoa -- $300 a week!'\" <br/><br/>Adversity, it would seem, is best visited upon the young, who don't know enough to be stymied by it. As lean as things were, the Taylor gang never was at a loss for good times. <br/><br/>\"Matt Guzzetta [currently Taylor's Senior Machine and Tool Designer] ran a motorcycle gas tank manufacturing shop right next door,\" Taylor remembered. \"We'd have these big, pot-luck, music-and-food parties once a month on a Saturday night. Everyone would open their shop and we'd have maybe four local bands going -- a lot of really great San Diego players. Matt ran his shop for years, and when it finally closed, I had him do a job for me at Taylor Guitars, and he's been here ever since. But if you ask Matt -- as much as he likes working here -- he'll tell you that we ruined everything and began going 'downhill' after we stopped having those parties.\" <br/><br/>In 1981, Taylor Guitars took out a bank loan to purchase equipment that would enable them to smooth out some production wrinkles. But without the benefit of marketing, unsold guitars continued to pile up. A year later, they sold a number of guitars to a single dealer, and used the cash to put Listug on the road in a quest for new dealers. <br/><br/>\"I told him, 'Don't even come back if you don't get any orders,'\" Taylor laughs. <br/><br/>Listug's new role of traveling salesman took him throughout California and as far as Maine. Being away from the daily grind of the business renewed his energy and perspective, but the trip wasn't without its disasters. <br/><br/>\"I had second thoughts about all this when my car broke down in a snowstorm in Wisconsin,\" he says. \"But the dealers I visited loved our guitars. On the way home, I sold the six guitars I had with me, so we had cash for Christmas.\" <br/><br/>In 1983, Taylor and Listug bought out Schemmer. Newly equipped with machines they'd designed to handle the most laborious aspects of tooling and processing raw materials, the streamlined company finally began turning a profit. The influx of money was spent on technical refinements that resulted in higher-caliber guitars. Things were looking up, but a breakthrough was needed. It would come from a most unexpected source. <br/> <br/>In the mid-'80s, synthesized rock so dominated the charts and airwaves that acoustic guitars seemed anachronistic -- the implements of coffeehouse folkies and '60s diehards. Up to that time, Taylor Guitars had allowed its distributor to represent the company at the semi-annual trade shows of the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). But, in 1984, Taylor and Listug exhibited their own guitars at the winter NAMM show, and ran smack into that era's industry realities. <br/>\"Those NAMM shows were hard,\" Listug says. \"We were set up near the Martin booth in 1985, when we showed our Artist Series [limited-edition, color-stained guitars]. Even Martin was singing the blues about how lousy business was.\" <br/><br/>Hoping to lure rockers into trying their acoustics, Taylor and Listug accepted a challenge from Glenn Wetterlund of Podium Music in Minneapolis to create a guitar for one of the day's superstars -- Prince, who needed a 12-string for some recording sessions. At the time, Prince was in his \"purple\" phase, so Taylor made him a purple-stained 655. But, there was a catch: Prince would not perform with instruments bearing a visible brand name. As a result, Taylor would make a guitar that would be seen by millions (Prince played it in both his Purple Rain and Live Aid videos) -- and the Taylor logo would be nowhere in sight. <br/><br/>Whether the \"Prince guitar\" in any way impacted the eventual re-emergence of the acoustic guitar is debatable, but it sure didn't hurt Taylor Guitars. By then, word of Bob Taylor's handiwork was spreading through the music world, and famous and unknown musicians alike were snapping up his guitars.

Soon the name was changed to the Gluek Brewing Company, and by 1964 became Minneapolis's oldest continuously operated business.<br/><br/>In 1858 the company brewed 3,996 barrels of beer and by 1901 the annual capacity of 150,000 barrels, which was second only to the two \"giants\" the Minneapolis Brewing Company (later Grain Belt Brewery) and the Theo. Hamm Brewery of St. Paul, each with capacities of 500,000 barrels.<br/><br/>The earliest mode of delivery was by horse-drawn wagon, which limited the geographic area that could be served. Prior to Prohibition, 95 percent of Gluek sales were in the city of Minneapolis. The Gluek Company maintained a stable of huge horses hauling a mammoth beer wagon full of barrels of the golden brew. There were 110 of those horses during their heyday. Those sleek, powerful teams of Percheron draft horses, the early trademark of the brewing industry, soon gave way to trucks. They reappeared on city streets during WWII when company vice president Arthur Gluek put them back to work to conserve gasoline and rubber for the war effort.<br/><br/>Gottlieb Gluek worked hard to keep his dream going and growing. Even a fire in March of 1880 that gutted the brewery could not stop his dream from happening. Luckily no life was lost but the brewery was insufficiently insured and the Gluek family took a $20,000 loss. It was never officially determined how the fire started. But, notwithstanding the reservations of others, the brewery Gottlieb Gluek rebuilt was larger and more modern than its predecessor, and it was rebuilt entirely with Gluek family funds. The real cost of the tragedy, however, was much greater. The strain of the loss and the effort to rebuild the plant probably contributed to the unexpected death of it's founder in October of that year at the age of fifty-two.<br/><br/>By 1920 of the 114 breweries that started between 1878 and 1920, 51 had survived, only to be devastated in the 1920 \"noble experiment\" of Prohibition. During that period Gluek did what many other breweries did, turned to \"near beer\" and soft drinks along with other products. But nearly half of the Minnesota breweries would not survive to celebrate the Repeal.<br/><br/>When Prohibition ended April 7, 1933, Gluek went back into production. Alvin Gluek, then plant superintendent, was concerned about their customers and told the local press that \"police protection will be necessary if the lame and the halt are not to be trampled underfoot, and fenders and running boards of family automobiles are not to be squeezed and bumped.\"<br/><br/>Gluek kept pace with technology, first by using one-way containers (cans) for their beer. Then by introducing a revolutionary new malt beverage called \"Stite\" a forerunner of today's \"light beer\". Some drinkers claimed it had a higher than average alcohol content and gained the name of \"Green Lightning\".<br/><br/>But, grudgingly, in 1964, the Gluek family bowed to economic reality. The venerable old brewery at 20th and Marshall was sold to the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin. And, in the name of progress, it was demolished two years later.<br/><br/>Although it languished in relative obscurity and changed hands more than once, the Gluek Brand \"Family of Beers\" finally returned home in 1997, ironically just up the road from where Gottlieb Gluek began the legend.<br/><br/>The Gluek Brewing Company of today is much like its namesake, dedicated to brewing the finest beer from the finest ingredients, regardless of cost. The Gluek water source is world famous, bubbling from deep within the crystalline granite of Stearns County, Minnesota. The water, which requires no additional filtration, produces a beer of extraordinary taste and purity. </div> "}, "id": "QMCTYT4BEHX7SI17"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/connecticut/stonington-vineyards", "City": "Test", "Name": "Stonington Vineyards", "Longitude": -71.900155, "State/Province": "Connecticut", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 41.415569, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " <br/>Stonington Vineyards was established by Nick and Happy Smith in 1987, when purchasing 58 acres in the Stonington Uplands on which winegrapes had been planted earlier in the decade.

By the 1830?s and 1840?s, European settlers found that the Finger Lakes region provided such favorable growing conditions that grapes had outgrown home production capacities. On March 15, 1860, Charles Davenport Champlin and 12 local businessmen consolidated their holdings under ?Articles of Association for the Manufacture of Native Wine? and, with $10,000 capitalization, built the first winery in this region, The Hammondsport and Pleasant Valley Wine Company, which was designated as Bonded Winery No.1 in its State and Federal districts. <br/><br/>The original winery was constructed on land whose price had soared from $10 to $100 an acre in one decade! It was built on a slope owned by Mr. Champlin overlooking Pleasant Valley, two miles south of Hammondsport. All wine making operations were carried out by Jules and Joseph Masson, noted French-born winemakers of the time, in still-used wooden and stone structures, with adjacent cellars carved deep into the hillside. Eight of these Great Western Winery buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.<br/><br/>During the winery?s first year of operation, 18 tons of Isabella and Catawba grapes were harvested, yielding 220 gallons of wine per ton. On August 17, 1862, the first recorded shipment, 100 gallons of wine, left the winery. Business thrived. While the Civil War brought supply and labor shortages, as well as price increases and transportation difficulties, the enterprise was sufficiently successful in 1865 to invest in champagne-producing equipment. Twenty thousand bottles of Sparkling Catawba were made that year. In 1867, this wine was awarded honorable mention at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, the first American Sparkling wine to win an award in Europe. In 1873 in Vienna, the winery?s champagne was awarded first prize and its first European medal; since then the Company?s champagnes have received numerous European gold medals and other awards. <br/><br/>Because of the internationally recognized excellence of Pleasant Valley Champagnes and because of the similarities of climatic and soil conditions between the area and the Champagne district of France, Pleasant Valley came to be called the ?Rheims of America.? When the U.S. Postal Service opened a branch at the winery in 1870, it used the postmark, ?Rheims, N.Y.?, which was used until 1945 when rural delivery took its place.<br/><br/>In March 1871, Mr. Champlin sent a case of champagne to his close friend, Marshall P. Wilder, who was a well-known wine connoisseur in Boston. After introducing it at a dinner party at the Parker House, Wilder declared it to be \"the Great Champagne of the Western World.\" The Champagne was thus dubbed ?Great Western.?<br/><br/>Shipping records of the 1860?s, 70?s, and 80?s are filled with such prestigious accounts as S.S. Pierce, Macy?s, Park Tilford, George F. Hueblin and Brother, Palmer House of Chicago, Parker House of Boston and individuals such as Professor Henry W. Longfellow of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Pleasant Valley wines appeared on the lists of the most fashionable restaurants. They were even heartily recommended by doctors for their medicinal qualities. <br/><br/>These were exciting years at Pleasant Valley. From 1872 to 1875, Mr. Champlin and area businessmen built the nine-mile Bath to Hammondsport Railroad to combat price increases of canal transportation. Not only was this a successful business venture, but it also brought tourists to the area to ride the Keuka Lake steamers, such as Lulu and Urbana, at 10 cents a ride. Later, on March 8, 1893, the Pleasant Valley Wine Company was registered as a New York State corporation, with the Champlins and Massons holding 205 of 400 outstanding shares of stock. Adding further excitement, on July 4, 1908, Glenn Curtiss made the first pre-announced airplane flight on the Pleasant Valley flats directly below the winery entrance. The world-renowned Curtiss Museum, dedicated to his flying endeavors and the remarkable decades when Hammondsport epitomized the country?s spirit of innovation, attracts aviation enthusiasts from around the world to its spacious quarters across Pleasant Valley from the winery. <br/><br/>The good news that Pleasant Valley had sold more champagne in the first six months of 1919 than in any previous year was marred on July 1 by the enactment of Prohibition. The winery was left with an inventory of 70,000 cases of champagne and substantial quantities of still wine. Yet it survived the 14 years of Prohibition on sales for sacramental and medicinal purposes.<br/><br/>After Repeal in 1933, the Company progressed steadily. Charles D. Champlin II, grandson of the founder and dean of American champagne makers of his time, managed the operation until his death in 1950. The family retained control of the business until 1955 when it was sold to a company run by Marne Obernauer, a businessman from New Jersey, who officially renamed the winery Pleasant Valley Division of Great Western Producers. In 1961, the winery was acquired by The Taylor Wine Company, its next-door neighbor, which was itself acquired first by The Coca-Cola Company in 1977, then Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons in 1983 and finally Vintners International Company, Inc., in 1987. Having survived Prohibition and several ownership changes, the winery returned once again to local family control in 1995.<br/><br/>Great Western Winery has the largest plantings of the vinifera varieties Chardonnay and Riesling in the East, pioneered French-American varietals in the 1960?s, was the first New York State winery to produce natural ice wines and is the only New York winery to have won the Governor?s Cup for the ?Best Wine in New York? two years in a row. The winery is the largest producer of bottle-fermented champagnes in the eastern United State and for over a century Great Western Champagnes have been the most-honored American Champagnes in European competition and have enhanced the wine lists of some of the most prestigious American hotels and restaurants. </div> "}, "id": "R2NM3UTOUINVIBCF"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/pennsylvania/utz-snacks", "City": "Test", "Name": "Utz Snacks", "Longitude": -76.998841, "State/Province": "Pennsylvania", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 39.813438, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Utz Quality Foods, Inc. was started in 1921 by Bill and Salie Utz in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Bill Utz, dissatisfied with the quality of potato chips being produced at the time, believed so strongly in the marketability of a wholesome quality chip that he quit his job and risked it all to begin producing the couple's own brand of potato chips.<br/><br/>Under the brand name of \"Hanover Home Brand Potato Chips\", Salie used her knowledge of good Pennsylvania Dutch cooking to make the chips in a small summer house behind their home on McAllister Street.<br/><br/>The hand operated equipment she used made about 50 pounds of chips per hour. Bill delivered the chips to independent stores and farmers' markets in the Hanover and Baltimore area. Demand for the chips grew rapidly, and Salie and Bill soon built a separate building behind their house. In 1936, they installed one of the first automatic potato chip cookers, capable of producing 300 pounds per hour. F.X. \"Xav\" Rice, who married Arlene Utz, one of Bill and Salie's two daughters, joined the organization to manage business operations.<br/><br/>When F.X. Rice retired in 1978, his son Michael Rice took over as the third generation of Utz management. This new team is leading major expansion of Utz's operations. Utz was the first in the snack industry to use in-truck computers to prepare invoices, manage inventory, and process route accounting transactions. <br/><br/>The steady growth of Utz Quality Foods is a reflection of Utz quality... in its facilities, in its products, and in its people.

Two years ago or twenty, they remind you incessantly of what they did. Ask them what they've done lately, though, and you find yourself facing a blank stare. <br/><br/>Then there are those who are never satisfied; who are continually perfecting and innovating, experimenting with new ideas and trying to improve on the old. So it is with the folks at Deering Banjo Company in Lemon Grove, Cal. <br/><br/>Twenty years ago Greg and Janet Deering started out with a dream to build a quality instrument a beginner could afford. Back then, inexpensive beginners' banjos were cheaply made and sounded that way. The plastic or aluminum pots just didn't have the ring of the ones professionals played. Consequently, students quickly became discouraged and gave up shortly after trying to learn to play. (And anything that sounded good cost more than a beginner wanted to shell out.) <br/><br/>So, in 1978, after three years subcontracting banjo parts for a high-end brand the Deerings developed and marketed their Basic and Intermediate banjos featuring a steel pot and a mahogany neck. Their rich tone and easy action still amaze listeners and pickers alike; yet the price was affordable for someone just starting out. <br/><br/>The Deerings could have been satisfied there. Their place in that market was secure; why mess with success? But they weren't. Over the years, they went on to develop a whole line of professional quality instruments from the Sierra and Deluxe models that features a three-ply maple rim and mahogany neck to the Gabriella that features a Brazilian rosewood neck, a mother-of- pearl fingerboard and vine peghead inlay. <br/><br/>Their six- and 12-string acoustic banjos and Crossfire electric banjos have spawned a whole new interest in the banjo from previously untapped corners of the music spectrum. They have been responsible at least in part for the instrument's crossover from a purely folk and bluegrass instrument to one now heard in the country, rock, and jazz genres. Tune around the FM dial sometime. You'll hear names like Joe Satriani, Rod Stewart, John Hartford, John Sebastian, Jimmy Olandei (of Diamond Rio),Jeff Cook (of Alabama), and Bela Fleck playing Deering electric and acoustic instruments. Coming off the success of Garth Brooks' hit single and video \"Callin' Baton Rouge,\" that features Bela Fleck on the Crossfire, Brooks recently ordered a new Crossfire for his band, Janet Deering says. <br/><br/>\"Our goal has always been to build what banjo players want,\" Greg Deering says matter-of-factly. Janet adds their design was to \"help expand bluegrass music as well as make banjos that can be used in other music forms. That way a broader spectrum of people can enjoy the banjo. <br/>\"That's the difference between us and other companies,\" Janet adds. \"We're working to make the banjo market grow. The rest of them are all fighting for a piece of the same pie.\" <br/><br/>But it was neither thoughts of big names nor of owning his own business that motivated Greg to design and build his first instrument:. As with most cases of motherhood and invention, necessity spawned Greg's first creation. Greg had been playing banjo as a college student in the '60s for about six years by then; he needed a better banjo but couldn't afford to buy one. Building his own wasn't the end of Greg's banjo making, though; other pickers saw his banjo and wanted one for themselves. <br/>Greg says he was unable to hang onto a banjo until he finally built a long-neck, folk model. Back then, the long-neck variety made popular by Pete Seeger and the folk boom was not as big as it is today. And while he still has the original long-neck he built for himself, he says orders for them have increased steadily over the years from one to quite a few each year. He explains fans of the Kingston Trio from the '50s and '60s have grown and probably have settled with families and careers now. They have enough time to learn the instruments and the old songs. Today, Deering Banjo Company sells a substantial number of long-neck folk banjos in a variety of models for those of us who never outgrew the folk era. <br/>Not, long after that, Greg says he switched his major at San Diego State University from Biology to Industrial Arts, ultimately constructing a banjo for his final project. Greg recalls his professor gave him a B on the final, stating the instrument was too good; he couldn't have done all the work himself. <br/><br/>Ever thought of inviting the old man out for a tour of the shop since then, Greg? Maybe sending him a catalog? From there, Greg went to work for American Dream Music in Lemon Grove as a repairman, working there for about four years until 1974 when he and Janet were married and Taylor Guitars bought out American Dream. They opened Deering Banjo Company out of their home in 1975. <br/><br/>\"Our living room was our shipping and receiving area,\" Janet grins. \"Our bedroom was the office; the patio was the assembly area; the garage our wood shop. We sprayed banjos on the back porch.\" Times were tough then; many times Janet says she had to personally deliver a load of banjos to dealers upstate and then run to the bank afterward so the family could put food on the table. <br/><br/>Deering Banjos moved into more accommodating quarters in Lemon Grove about a year later when the Fire Marshal started asking questions about their operation. They finally settled into their place at 7936 Lester Avenue in 1983. <br/><br/>After the success of their Basic and Intermediate lines, the Deerings added the Deluxe, the Maple Blossom, and Calico banjos that featured a wood pot, a mahogany neck, an ebony fingerboard inlaid in mother-of-pearl, and a bell-bronze tone ring. The three-ply maple pot. was introduced in 1981. The GDL (Greg Deering Ltd.) followed a year later and the Ivanhoe, featuring mother-of-pearl and abalone inlay with all hardware is gold plated and engraved, a year after that. <br/>The Deerings made a major breakthrough when they showed up at the 1985 NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) show with their Crossfire, the first. electric banjo that worked. Until then, other instrument manufacturers had tried and failed in attempts to create an electric banjo. The instruments either were plagued with feedback problems or they sounded too much like guitars. This one sounded like a banjo. Janet recalls the new Crossfires drew quite a crowd of onlookers. <br/><br/>\"People thought it was strange; they didn't know what to think of it,\" Janet recalls. \"I explained it was like an electric guitar. The shape was designed so it would fit into an electric guitar case; the 'horns' housed the electronics.\" She adds that more than 90 percent of the Crossfires are ordered in black because many players wear a black shirt or jacket; to hide the instrument's odd shape. From a distance, the white head gives the instrument the round banjo shape. <br/><br/>Originally, the Crossfire could be ordered with either the banjo or six- string guitar neck. But in 1993, Deering discontinued the six-string version. As fate would have it, Jeff Cook of Alabama ordered one with the six-string neck shortly thereafter. He played it on the Grand Ole Opry this summer. Many bluegrass banjo players are also playing the Crossfire electrics in country and rock bands on the side, Janet says. <br/>The Crossfire comes with two pick ups that can be selected for a guitar or a banjo sound, or for the two in combination. Greg and Janet have worked with Bernie Leadon (formerly of the Eagles and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and Bela Fleck since the first Crossfire to perfect the instrument, recently coming up with a new pickup they say works even better than the ones they initially used. Greg notes it has a \"cleaner, quieter sound. And it's easier to link up with wireless and other sound systems.\" <br/><br/>(If you're one of those who own a Crossfire that still uses the old pick-up, write or call Deering about having your instrument refitted with the new style.) <br/>Besides some 15 models in a variety of styles (five-string, bluegrass, long-neck, tenor, plectrum, left-handed, six- and 12-string, archtop, flattop), Deering does a considerable amount. of custom work. If you can draw or describe the design you want, Deering craftsmen can probably build it. Such was the case recently for George Grove of the Kingston Trio. George wanted a long-neck banjo with the fingerboard and peghead inlaid in a dinosaur scene. Not just dinosaurs at the usual fret markers, an entire prehistoric scene including landscape inlaid from peghead to pot. He got it, too; an instrument he dubbed his \"Banjosauris.\" Greg and Chuck Neitzel, one of Deering's top craftsmen, designed and laid out the fingerboard. And Jeremiah, Greg and Janet's son, drew the peghead design. <br/>Bela Fleck ordered a purple Crossfire inlaid in a cosmic hippo design after his \"Flight Of The Cosmic Hippo\" CD. And, yes, it matches a purple shirt he wears onstage. <br/><br/>Texas banjo player and bluegrass DJ Tony Ullrich ordered a line of 151 banjos to commemorate each year of the Texas Sesquicentennial from 1836 to 1986. The peghead and fingerboard are inlaid in spurs, a hat, a boot, crossed pistols, the Alamo, a lariat, and flags of Texas and the United States. <br/>The Deerings also built a model for John Hartford. The Hartford can he ordered with either the bell-bronze or a wood tone ring made from Granadillo. Enthusiasts of the wood tone note the banjo still packs plenty of punch but produces a more rounded note and is lighter in weight than the bell-bronze tone ring. <br/><br/>Still progressing, the Deerings released their new Hartford model this year. What sets the new Hartford apart is its 24-fret fingerboard. Unlike the long-neck which positions an extra three frets at the peghead end of the fingerboard, the Hartford adds two additional frets at the bottom (pot) end. This moves the bridge more toward the middle of the head, bringing out the full tone of the instrument. <br/>As head of marketing, Janet keeps her hand on the pulse of the market to learn how they compare in sales with other banjo makers. Much of the success goes to Janet's marketing savvy. <br/><br/>\"It's mostly common sense,\" she shrugs. \"That and a weekend marketing seminar I took a few years ago. Sales really took off about 1986 when we came out. with our color catalog.\" <br/><br/>The company's workforce has increased to keep pace; but, at more than a dozen employees on the payroll now, it still hasn't lost its family atmosphere. On any given day, you'll see Greg binding resonators or setting up a Crossfire, Jeremiah turning a pot or punching out a flange, and Jamie, the Deerings' daughter, and Janet filling in wherever they can to help fill an order. However, Janet says she doesn't get to put in as much time in the shop as she used to. \"I miss it,\" she says. <br/><br/>Two of Deering's craftsmen, Chuck Neitzel and Wendell Weisner, have been with the company better than 25 years between them. And another employee describes banjo making as \"the most fun you can have with your clothes on.\" <br/><br/>The location helps the atmosphere as well. Lemon Grove is a small community east of downtown San Diego with a small town flavor. (Greg tells visitors to look for the big mailbox in back of the Lemon Grove Post Office as you're coming down Lester Avenue. When you see it, they're right across the street - 7936 Lester Ave., Lemon Grove, CA 91945, 1-800-845-7791) <br/><br/>Deering has expanded its quarters as well to include new space for an additional setup bench, a new office and showroom and recently-acquired space for more room for the machine shop. <br/><br/>As for the future, Greg smiles and admits, \"I think all of us are hoping for another Deliverance,\" another movie like that or Bonnie And Clyde that featured banjo music and brought the instrument more publicity and increased banjo sales. \"Banjo sales really jumped after that movie came out,\" he says. <br/><br/>Beyond that, Janet doesn't say much about future plans. \"We have things in the works right now, but we're keeping them quiet for marketing reasons.\" </div> "}, "id": "R9TAYPQMVC10NAA7"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/california/sequoia-grove-vineyards", "City": "Test", "Name": "Sequoia Grove Vineyards", "Longitude": -122.413252, "State/Province": "California", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 38.448713, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Sequoia Grove Vineyards was founded in 1978 by Jim Allen, whose love for European wines inspired him to discover Napa Valley in the early days, and whose determination has produced elegant, award-winning wines of depth and character ever since.

The Carneros Appellation is the first American Viticultural appellation to be defined according to climate rather than along political lines. The appellation is characterized by a long, moderately cool growing season tempered by the maritime breezes and lingering fog off the San Pablo Bay just to the south. These are optimum growing conditions for pinot noir and chardonnay, the two primary grape varieties used in Domaine Carneros wines.<br/><br/>Domaine Carneros farms 195 planted acres of vineyards on three different Carneros vineyard sites. There are 35 different blocks within our three vineyards. Each block is unique either because of the scion/rootstock combination (this is the grape variety grafted onto a pest-resistant rootstock) or because of the terrain of the block (i.e. slope, direction of rows, soil, sun exposure, etc.) Similar to an artist having many colors in a palette, this provides a variety of components from which our winemakers can create their blends each vintage. To add to this, we have thirteen different clonal selections (six chardonnay and seven pinot noir) all of which were selected for their flavor and intensity.<br/><br/>Almost all of the grapes for Domaine Carneros? wines come from our own estate vineyards. This is important for two reasons. First it allows the winery to control and direct the production from the vineyard to the bottle, and secondly it allows for continuity in our product resulting in a consistency in our wines. Our vineyards are farmed with the point of view that quality and not tonnage is the primary goal. All of our clones have small-to-medium sized clusters, allowing greater flavor concentration. We also prune each block, during the spring, to remove weak shoots that would add tonnage but would bring down the quality of the fruit because of lack of maturity.<br/><br/>At Domaine Carneros, we know that to maintain the longevity of our vineyards and to protect the surrounding wildlife, we need to farm responsibly in a way that preserves the soils, eliminates erosion and preserves the local ecology. We have made several changes with these efforts in mind. We have moved to the use of mechanical weed removers to reduce herbicides and use chemicals that are either organic or environmentally safe. We have been able to do this by understanding life cycles of diseases and pests by careful observation in the vineyards. We are also introducing more cover crops, which are planted between the vine rows to stabilize the soils in the wet seasons and provide nutrients and organic matter to our soils. In addition, we work with the Napa Resource Conservation District (NRCD), an organization put together by the growers along Huichica Creek a sensitive water and wildlife area. </div> "}, "id": "RKI6LDP6O71KD1GM"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/gray-brewing-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Gray Brewing Company", "Longitude": -89.049808, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 42.679383, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " This micro-brewery prides itself on its flavorful line of beers, rootbeer and cream soda.

We began with an old tried and true formula from Swiss soap makers that would incorporate all the beneficial qualities of the natural ingredients and customized it to our design. <br/><br/>In an effort to keep the product handmade from start to finish, a small soap factory was built on the farm. Even though the product line is ever expanding, all work is done individually and with personal care. <br/><br/>Our all natural goat milk soap is delicately handcrafted at Emerald Farm. Our 20 years of experience in dairy goat farming has led us to the production of this luxury product. <br/><br/>For almost as long as recorded history, men have regarded soap as one of man's gracious inventions. Reference shows as long ago as 2300 B.C. bathing and skin care was important. The Romans and Greeks built elaborate buildings of marble to house their baths. Soap was a precious luxury and used sparingly. <br/><br/>In an age where so many things are not as they appear to be, and made of artificial substances, we believe it is essential to offer a wholesome product, made of ALL NATURAL ingredients. Returning to basics is a pleasant way to renew natural skin qualities. <br/><br/>SAANEN SOAP is handmade from the pure whole goat milk produced on our farm. The milk is delicately blended with powder soft oatmeal and scented with natural herbal oils. The soothing qualities of our whole milk and deep cleaning oatmeal embraces your skin, leaving it clean and refreshed without artificial residues. <br/><br/>Milk of all kinds has been known as a rejuvenator and moisturizer of human skin. From the days of Cleopatra and her ritual beauty baths, olive oil has maintained its reputation for enriching skin beauty. For this reason, we have combined the age old secrets used by soapmakers for centuries with out all natural ingredients, creating our second bar, SAANEN SILK. This beauty bar is the combination of our whole goat milk and olive oil. SAANEN SILK gently cleanses as it enriches your skin. <br/><br/>Cosmetic chemists are calling goat milk \"natures' liposome\". These are easily absorbed into the skin, bringing moisture and restorative proteins, minerals and vitamins necessary to maintain the healthy texture of the skin.<br/><br/>Saanen Soap is a gentle all natural luxury product recommended for the entire family- from infants to seniors. </div> "}, "id": "RVABXHM40IEEA0PE"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/ohio/anthony-thomas-candy-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "Anthony-Thomas Candy Company", "Longitude": -83.126279, "State/Province": "Ohio", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 39.950869, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Four generations of Zanetos candy makers have contributed to the company's success.

The 50-horsepower water wheel generated electricity and ran the mill's 21 looms and knitting machines, which converted heavy Wisconsin wool into yarns, blankets, flannels -- and even socks for the old Chicago White Sox!<br/><br/>In 1972, the building was converted to a winery by Jim &amp; Sandi Pape and became known as the Newberry and later the Stone Mill Winery. The upper floors of the mill were converted to shops. The winery in the 70's was famous for its cherry wines and the unique clay bottles they were bottled in. Traditional European casks were used for about ten years, and then replaced with stainless steel tanks and smaller barrels.<br/><br/>In 1990, the winery was purchased by the Wollersheim family and became the Cedar Creek Winery. The wine style changed to focus on traditional style grape wines with a few grape-based fruit wines. The building's cool limestone underground cellars provide an ideal environment for fermenting and aging wines in oak barrels.<br/><br/>Cedar Creek Winery shares the same winemaker as Wollersheim Winery in<br/>Prairie du Sac, winemaker Philippe Coquard, but the two brands remain distinct. Cedar Creek wines have received recognition in both national and international wine competitions. <br/><br/>The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes and concludes with a wine tasting.<br/>Tour fees are $3.00 for adults.

But the founding of Mrs Baird's Bread wasn't exactly a smooth road.<br/><br/>In 1901 William and Ninnie Baird brought their family from Tennessee to Fort Worth, Texas. William, a restaurateur by trade, set up a business in downtown Fort Worth selling popcorn from a bright red cart with brass fittings and a loud steam whistle. Within months his success led him to buy another popcorn cart which was run by his oldest son, Dewey, only eight-years-old. But it wasn't long before William Baird decided to get back into the restaurant business.<br/><br/>By 1905, William Baird had started, built up and sold one restaurant and was working on his second, when he received devastating news. He was diagnosed as having diabetes, in those days an incurable and untreatable disease.<br/><br/>Although very ill, William Baird and his young son Dewey worked in the family restaurant. Ninnie Baird tended to the home and her three other sons, and like everyone else of that time, she baked for her family.<br/><br/>Every day she would cut wood to fire the wood-burning stove. It was hot, sometimes dirty work, but in spite of the lack of modern conveniences, Mrs. Baird became a wonderful baker. The loaves of bread, cakes and pies she baked, the family enjoyed. Any extra was shared with the neighbors. Her bread was so delicious that it wasn't long before her reputation was known far and wide.<br/><br/>Ninnie did all her baking in a wood-fired stove...<br/><br/>In 1908, with William's health failing, it became impossible for him to continue working. It was clear that Ninnie Baird needed to find a way to help support her family, so she established Mrs Baird's Bread.<br/><br/>In 1911, William died and Ninnie Baird decided to continue the business she had begun. Every day, in her home, in a wood-burning stove that could bake only four loaves at a time, Ninnie baked her wonderful bread, cakes and pies. Her boys helped bake and deliver the bread on foot. Her daughters took care of the smaller children and did other chores around the house. Mrs Baird's Bread was truly a family business.<br/><br/>As business grew, the boys went from delivering bread on foot, to riding bicycles.<br/><br/>In 1915, demand for Mrs Baird's bread had outgrown Ninnie's wood-burning stove. A larger oven was needed so she bought a commercial oven from the Metropolitan Hotel in Fort Worth. Unable to pay cash for the $75 oven, Ninnie put down $25 and paid out the rest in bread and rolls. The new oven, which could bake 40 loaves at a time, was installed in a small wooden building in the family's backyard.<br/><br/>Sales continued to grow to the point where the boys could not make deliveries on their bicycles. So, the Baird's buggy was converted into a wagon and pulled by the family horse, Ned. The first company employee, Mr. Lipps, who was not a Baird family member, was hired to drive the wagon.<br/><br/>Ned, it turns out, was quite a delivery horse. He came to know the route so well that he would stop at every customer's house without the urging of his driver. Over time, delivering to the sales route became son Hoyt's job. In 1917 the family bought a Ford passenger car, took out the seats and painted \"Eat More Mrs Baird's Bread\" on the sides.<br/><br/>Old Ned retires and expansion begins...<br/><br/>About this time Mrs Baird's Bread began selling to commercial accounts. Two Telephone Exchanges bought pies daily and Sandegard's Grocery became the company's first bread reseller. Sandegard's, a large store with a delicatessen, proved to be a very good customer as it soon grew to 15 stores, all displaying Mrs Baird's Bread prominently in a glass case.<br/><br/>In 1918, Hoyt Baird left Fort Worth to join the Army, leaving the company without a delivery driver. It was decided to discontinue selling direct and concentrate instead on selling only wholesale. Demand steadily increased, and so did the bakery. Now located at 6th Avenue and Terrell Street, the little 30 foot by 72 foot facility housed an oven that could bake 400 loaves at a time. Wholesale deliveries now stretched into every corner of Fort Worth, where fresh-baked bread, rolls, cakes and pies were delivered every day. Over the next ten years the bakery was enlarged nine times, until it was one of the largest baking facilities in Texas.<br/><br/>In 1928, the Bairds opened a new bakery across the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The stock market crash of 1929 signaled the start of the Great Depression, and, like everyone else, Mrs Baird's Bread had to cut back to survive those lean times. By 1938, business was returning to normal and the bakery needed to expand again. They built a new bakery in Houston, Texas and added another plant in Fort Worth. Once a one-horse delivery system, now a fleet of trucks was needed at each of the four bakeries. The two new bakeries also featured plate glass windows so that visitors could watch the baking process. Not only could you smell the delicious bread, but you could watch it being made as well.<br/><br/>In the 1940's, America entered World War II and the country saw a shortage of many items, like sugar. Because they went off to fight the war, workers were also in short supply. These shortages forced Mrs Baird's to reduce the number and kinds of bread product it baked, but it never compromised on quality. If an ingredient was in short supply, then the bakery just didn't bake that item for a while.<br/><br/>Post War Growth establishes Mrs Baird's as Texas' Bread<br/><br/>Following the war, in 1949, Mrs Baird's expanded again building a bakery in Abilene, Texas. In 1959 and 1960 the company acquired bakeries in the Texas cities of Victoria, Lubbock, Waco and Austin.<br/><br/>Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, the company prospered. Ninnie Baird, the namesake of the thriving company, however, experienced declining health. Now 80, she stayed at home most of the time. The boys handled most of the day-to-day operations, but Ninnie Baird, still the Chairman of the Board, was always consulted on the major decisions. The family's commitment to quality, freshness and service never waivered. It was a work ethic that was passed on from generation to generation as well as, the importance of family, a Christian upbringing, and community. From the beginning until her death, she shared with her neighbors and her community.<br/><br/>Tour one of Mrs Baird's Bakeries and see firsthand how Mrs Baird's Bread is baked.

On the second floor you will see the Designer's corner, where nine leading American stained glass studios have each contributed for display, a beautiful exhibit of their artistry as practiced today. <br/><br/>Also, a museum containing a Country Music Award trophy, Presidential Gifts, U.S. Capitol lighting globes, and original Williamsburg\u00ae stemware. From a special observation deck you can look into a large area inside the plant and watch molten glass take its final form. <br/><br/>Blenko has always had a magnet-like attraction for people. Singly, in small groups, or by the bus load, visitors have come even from the far places of the world to watch while skilled craftsmen make beautiful, translucent glassware. <br/><br/>Now from a special observation deck, visitors can observe the various steps in handcrafting glass; the furnace where silica sand, combined with other materials, is fused under intense heat; the gatherer who takes from this mass a small amount or \"gob\" of glass which he delivers to a blower, who blows the gob into a form, or shape, using tools similar to those of centuries ago. When the blower has re-heated the piece he has shaped, it is passed on to a finisher who does whatever is necessary for completion - adding handles, rings, etc.<br/><br/>Next, each piece is placed into an annealing lehr or oven, wherein, over a period of many hours gradual cooling to room temperature takes place. The skill of Blenko's expert craftsman is acquired only after many years of experience. As a result of excellence Blenko ware has been shown in museums and cultural exhibitions throughout the world, and has received numerous awards. Leading gift shops and department stores in America, as well as abroad, have sold Blenko for many years. It is in demand everywhere. <br/><br/>Please come and have a rewarding visit in our factory outlet store, or experience the practice of one of the most ancient of man's arts, producing contemporary designs in glassware, while you watch. All those who make up the Blenko Glass Company extend to you a cordial invitation to come (or come again as the case may be) and enjoy all there is for one to see, and learn about, in the Blenko Visitor Center, Milton, West Virginia. </div> "}, "id": "SNPWM6UMM0FXUCOH"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/florida/als-family-farms", "City": "Test", "Name": "Al's Family Farms", "Longitude": -80.399429, "State/Province": "Florida", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 27.471098, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Welcome to Al's Family Farms in Fort Pierce, Florida on the Treasure Coast.<br/>Come take a tour of our Citrus Wash-line and Packinghouse and visit our<br/>\"O.J.

In addition to offering its regular line of yummy chocolates Daffin's provides gourmet chocolates through its Jean Marie Collection. This scrumptious collection offers unique hand-molded chocolates with extra special insides containing such things as whole nuts, and truffles. But most people don't realize the business has a long family tradition. With nearly 1OO years of experience and three generations in the fine art of candy making - the Daffin's name is renowned in the candy world. Paul \"Pete\" Daffin got his start in the candy business at an early age. If ever there was a man born to make milk chocolate it was Pete Daffin. \"The first thing I ever smelled was chocolate,\" Pete liked to say. Chocolate has an interesting history as it didn't catch on with the public until the 192Os. This wasn't a matter of people not enjoying the delicious taste of chocolate. Rather, it was the debut of air conditioning - which helped prevent chocolate from melting - that pushed chocolate sales through the roof. Prior to that it was uncommon for stores to carry chocolate past April because of the warm temperatures. <br/><br/>The original family store was started in 1903 by George Daffin in Woodsfield, Ohio. It was there that the Daffin legend was created through his eyes. After World War I George's son, Alec, moved the business to New Philadelphia, Ohio. After Alec Daffin's death in 1936 the store moved to Canton, Ohio, where his son, Paul Daffin, took over the operations of the store with the help of his mother Georgia Daffin. When the call came Pete served in the U.S. Army World War II in Italy and other parts of the European theater. <br/><br/>Shortly after returning from the war Pete decided to build his own store in Sharon. Backed with finesse in merchandising and a will to succeed the small downtown store was born in 1947. The shop also served as a factory for creating the delectable candy delights that made the Daffin's name famous. It was Pete Daffin, with the constant help of his wife, Jean, who launched the Daffin Candies name to a new level. With the help of a friend they created their now famous Peter Rabbit - a solid chocolate Rabbit sold during the Easter season. Peter Rabbit was an immediate, mouth-watering hit with the public. As demand for Daffin's candy soared, the couple moved their location to a bigger 20,000 square-foot store in Sharon. At the same time they built a new 30,000 square-foot candy factory - yes, an honest to goodness candy factory. <br/><br/>Tours are available at the factory in the neighboring town of Farrell. Since Sharon and Farrell sit close to Interstate 80 and 79 Daffin's store and factory have become must stops for travelers. A brain child of Paul Daffin was the Daffin's Chocolate Kingdom. The Chocolate Kingdom, located at the retail store in Sharon, included large chocolate animals and two large castles, and an entire miniature village with chocolate houses and railroads. Another fun family activity created by Mr. Daffin was Swizzle Stick Day. On this day an open house is held at the Farrell candy factory and visitors get to see how candy is created. Also, patrons get a free sample of a swizzle stick dipped in fresh candy filling with fresh chocolate dipped on top. Mr. Daffin passed away in February 1998 and the business is now run by Mrs. Daffin who is president and their daughter, Diane who serves as vice president. Mr. and Mrs. Daffin's nephew, Gary Sigler, is operations manager while his brother Joe, is in charge of tourism promotion. Connie Leon is manager of the Sharon store and oversees retail sales while Sandy Hoover is in charge of fund raising sales. Each piece of Daffin's candy continues to be hand-decorated, which is becoming a rarity in the candy business. Today, in addition to the Sharon flagship location, Daffin's has retail stores in Greenville, and Franklin in Pennsylvania along with a store in Warren, Ohio and other divisions of Daffin's Candies are Costello's Candies in Girard, Oh. and Grove City, Pa. Also, Daffin's has branched out and supplies more than 50 Hallmark stores and gift stores with their fine chocolate candy. </div> "}, "id": "SQY4H8ATVQJVZC69"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/wisconsin/widmers-cheese-cellars", "City": "Test", "Name": "Widmer's Cheese Cellars", "Longitude": -88.452644, "State/Province": "Wisconsin", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 43.517409, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " The story of Widmer's Cheese begins over 70 years ago, when our founder, John O.

The first ?corporate headquarters? was a three-bay garage where Dale had an office.<br/><br/>As the need for additional space for race cars and equipment grew, Dale and Teresa moved the offices into a brick house located next door on Coddle Creek Highway. There were five offices for a handful of employees with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. fielding a part-time Busch Series team for its namesake. <br/><br/>To say the team was successful would be an understatement. Dale and his team won 21 races, had 65 top-fives and 76 top-10 finishes. <br/><br/>While racing was a part-time job, the business side of Dale Earnhardt, Inc. was a full-time initiative. The popularity of racing was growing, and Dale was leading the industry in merchandise and sponsorship sales. That little office house was selling some big sponsorships that are still part of the Dale Earnhardt, Inc. corporate structure today.<br/><br/>When Dale and Teresa fielded a full-time Busch Series team and added a Craftsman Truck Series team in 1995, another shop had to be built. Jeff Green was the Busch driver through the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Ron Hornaday drove the truck from ?95-98 with NAPA Auto Stores as the sponsor.<br/><br/>In that second season, Hornaday and NAPA gave Dale Earnhardt, Inc. its first NASCAR Championship and repeated the achievement in 1998. In 1997, a young Modified ace from East Northport, N.Y. was called upon by Dale to drive his Busch car. <br/><br/>Enter Steve Park. But, he almost lost out on his chance when he didn?t believe the phone call from Dale really came from Dale.<br/><br/>?I just got back from the Saturday-night track when there was a message on my machine from someone saying he was Dale Earnhardt and wanted to talk to me,? Steve said. ?Well, I didn?t believe it and thought it was just one of my buddies playing a prank on me.<br/><br/>?Two days later, the phone rang again and in an instant I knew who it was. It was the real deal Dale and I was all ears.?<br/><br/>Steve took over the Busch ride with ACDelco as the sponsor for the 1997 season. He won three races en route to Rookie of the Year honors and finished third in points. <br/><br/>As the need for employees and race cars grew, so did the need for office space. In June of 1999, Dale and Teresa proudly opened the doors to the beautiful headquarters with administration offices, exquisite Trophy Room, showroom, retail store and home of the 1 Pennzoil team.<br/><br/>The golden exterior shines like a symbol of success in the light of day and the black marbled entrance commands respect upon entry. The architectural beauty of the main complex has become a ?must see? for race fans visiting the town called ?Race City USA.? It truly has become a corporate headquarters in every sense.<br/><br/>In 1998, Steve Park was moved to the Winston Cup Series ranks with Pennzoil on board with the 1 Chevrolet. That left the seat for the Busch Series car open for a new driver and Dale didn't have to look far for a replacement.<br/><br/>Dale Earnhardt Jr. spent some years racing in the Street Stock and Late Model ranks at tracks in the Carolinas. In 1996, he made the jump into NASCAR with his inaugural Busch Series start at Myrtle Beach (S.C.) Speedway.<br/><br/>Dale Jr. went on to capture the Busch Rookie of the Year honors in 1997 and Series Championships in 1998 and 1999. It was time for the company to grow once again and that brought forth the expansion of another new building.<br/><br/>Escalating the fact was that Dale Jr. and his Busch team were going Winston Cup racing for the 2000 season.<br/><br/>So, the red brick house that once served as the Dale Earnhardt, Inc. office was sacrificed and bulldozed to make way for Dale Jr. and the 8 Budweiser team. In that complex, the fabrication shop, licensing department, engineering and show car program offices can be found.<br/><br/>While a physical expansion hasn?t taken place since 1999, the company has grown internally. NAPA and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teamed together to move from Busch racing in 2000 to the Winston Cup ranks for 2001. That same shop now houses the 15 NAPA Chevys for Michael Waltrip.<br/><br/>As one of the premier race teams in NASCAR housed on 14 acres of land and utilizing 200,000 sq. feet of building space, Dale Earnhardt, Inc. serves as the benchmark for success in motorsports.<br/><br/>That is a fantastic and beautiful facility. There are immense windows through which one can view cars being worked on, etc, and a fascinating display of memories of Dale Earnhardt, Sr. There is also a store selling items of interest to fans. </div> "}, "id": "TETDUBTQ54K5IZZQ"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/colorado/hammonds-candies", "City": "Test", "Name": "Hammond's Candies", "Longitude": -104.978307, "State/Province": "Colorado", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 39.800288, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " When you're suddenly overcome by a craving for sweets -- you know, that sudden unstoppable need for sugar -- Hammond's Candies satisfies.

We avoid any shortcuts that might detract from the quality of our pickles. <br/><br/>Farmers from across northern Indiana, northwest Ohio and Southern Michigan bring us their freshly picked cucumbers straight from the fields. They are immediately \"graded\", that is, sorted into seven sizes. From there most will go to tanks for curing. The tanks, mostly of cypress, contain a salt brine solution in which the cucumbers will be transformed into pickles over a period of three months or longer. We're best known for our many varieties of processed pickles.<br/><br/>Those cucumbers that don't go immediately to the tanks become \"fresh pack\" pickles. These are washed, usually cut, packed and pasteurized. They can be eaten within three or four days of being packed. For example, Sechler's Bread and Butter Pickles and Kosher Spears are fresh pack.<br/><br/>Nobody takes more time and care in the process of making sweetened pickles. All of our products labeled \"sweet\" or \"candied\" have been through this process, the candied having been sweetened twice. We take up to two weeks for the sweetening process alone, (many pickle companies take only one day) to insure our pickles are sweetened all the way through. As we like to say: \"We could make them faster, but that wouldn't make them better.\" All the candied and most of our sweetened products are tank-cured, but you'll also find some among the fresh pack items.<br/><br/>As you'll see while perusing our product pages, cucumbers are only one ingredient among many to go into our product line. <br/><br/>Defects are minimized by our stringent quality control, another tradition at Sechler's. We inspect pickles at the grading stage, after processing and, if they're sliced, again after that. </div> "}, "id": "TLJH8DG7YEP3UTUC"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/maine/cold-river-vodka", "City": "Test", "Name": "Cold River Vodka", "Longitude": -70.105892, "State/Province": "Maine", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 43.855515, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " The idea for Cold River Vodka originated with brothers Lee and Donnie Thibodeau. Growing up in Presque Isle, the heart of Maine?s potato country, they listened to their father and uncles tell about their history of turning potatoes into vodka. However, the realities of tending to the potato crop and the rigors of the annual harvest left little time.<br/><br/>Five years ago, the idea of commercially producing vodka resurfaced between Donnie and Lee as they were driving back to their childhood home in Presque Isle. After years of thinking of business ideas and talking about the future of Maine?s potato industry, the two decided to make the best vodka from Maine potatoes.<br/><br/>Maine?s agricultural industry is always searching for ways to add value to staple crops. This goal complemented the Thibodeaus? desire to preserve Maine?s open space and become the only distillery in the country that would oversee its entire production ? from planting potato seed to bottling vodka.<br/><br/>They called longtime friend Bob Harkins, who had recently left his post as a ski area executive, and asked him to explore the feasibility of producing vodka using Maine potatoes and Maine water. With that call, the business was born.<br/><br/>The three needed someone who knew distilling and soon discovered Chris Dowe. After a decade of installing and consulting on breweries across the country, he wanted to spend more time with his family in Maine.<br/><br/>The four partners and their wives chose the name Cold River Vodka. Glaciers carved the Cold River through the backbone of western Maine millennia ago. From the aquifer that this clear, pristine river feeds, the distillery takes its water. From a dream to a reality, from the ground to glass, from spud to super-premium spirit ? this is Cold River Vodka. </div> "}, "id": "TOBUSRR08377UIMI"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/mississippi/stennis-space-center", "City": "Test", "Name": "Stennis Space Center", "Longitude": -89.588132, "State/Province": "Mississippi", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 30.362321, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " From the Launch Pad board a shuttle for a 25-minute narrated tour through the 125,000-acre acoustical buffer zone to America's largest rocket test complex where Space Shuttle Main Engines are tested!

Johnson on November 21, 1967. Founding Director Robert R. Wilson committed the laboratory to firm principles of scientific excellence, aesthetic beauty, stewardship of the land, fiscal responsibility and equality of opportunity. Universities Research Association built the laboratory, and has operated the facility under those principles since its founding. <br/>On May 11, 1974, the laboratory was renamed in honor of 1938 Nobel Prize winner Enrico Fermi, one of the preeminent physicists of the atomic age. Fermi's widow, Laura Fermi, spoke at the dedication ceremonies. <br/><br/>Two major components of the Standard Model of Fundamental Particles and Forces were discovered at Fermilab: the bottom quark (May-June 1977) and the top quark (February 1995). In July 2000, Fermilab experimenters announced the first direct observation of the tau neutrino, the last fundamental particle to be observed. Filling the final slot in the Standard Model, the tau neutrino set the stage for new discoveries and new physics with the inauguration of Collider Run II of the Tevatron in March 2001. <br/><br/>The Tevatron, four miles in circumference and originally named the Energy Doubler when it began operation in 1983, is the world's highest-energy particle accelerator. Its 1,000 superconducting magnets are cooled by liquid helium to -268 degrees C (-450 degrees F). Its low-temperature cooling system was the largest ever built when it was placed in operation in 1983. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers has designated the Tevatron cryogenic system an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. <br/><br/>Fermilab has added the two-mile Main Injector accelerator to increase the number of proton-antiproton collisions in the Tevatron, greatly enhancing the chances for important discoveries in Run II. The two apartment building-sized collider detectors, CDF and DZero, have undergone extensive upgrades during the nearly decade-long preparations for Run II. <br/><br/>Fermilab's 6,800-acre site was originally home to farmland, and to the village of Weston. Some of the original barns are still in use by the laboratory, for purposes ranging from storage to social events. A small burial ground, with headstones dating back to 1839, has been maintained in the northwest corner of the site. Robert Wilson was buried in the Pioneer Cemetery following his death on January 16, 2000 at the age of 85. <br/><br/>Among Wilson's early imprints on the lab was the establishment of a herd of American bison, symbolizing the Fermilab's presence on the frontiers of high-energy physics, and the connection to its prairie origins. The herd stands today, and new calves are born every spring. </div> "}, "id": "UBGQEY7OT2G7J8SS"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/iowa/the-kaleidoscope-factory", "City": "Test", "Name": "The Kaleidoscope Factory", "Longitude": -94.685518, "State/Province": "Iowa", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 42.551074, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Each one of my kaleidoscopes is a little different from any other I have made.

In addition, John David Duke owned a facility that manufactured basket liners and built a peach packinghouse in 1942 that was named J.D. Duke. In 1950 he changed the name of this business to Southern Orchard Supply Co. but business was taken over by his son-in-law David O. Lane, and grandson, Duke Lane, Sr. The farming name remained the same but the packing portion of the business became Lane Packing Company. <br/><br/>Following the retirement of his father, David O. Lane, Duke Lane, Sr., became sole owner and continued to pack peaches until 1975 at the same location that his grandfather had built. <br/>In 1976, Duke Lane, Sr. formed a partnership with the Russell Pearson family. Together they built a more modern packinghouse that was called Pearson &amp; Lane. This partnership was in operation until 1989. After the 1989 season, the Lane family began construction of a packinghouse that is located on the family farm. This facility is one of the most modern of its kind and was ready just in time for the 1990 crop. It was in 1990 that Duke Lane, Sr. turned the business over to his four children--Duke, Jr., Bobby, Anne, and Steve who continue to run the business today.<br/><br/>Since 1990, Lane Packing Company has continued to grow and expand. We have added a Roadside Market which includes the Peachtree Cafe, Just Peachy Gift Shop and a full service mail order department.

This commitment to performance has established a \"Tradition of Precision\" for which Sierra is known throughout the world.<br/><br/>Over the years, much has changed in the industry and in the marketplace. One common thread running throughout this time however, has been Sierra's focus on bullets. Hunting and target bullets for rifles and handguns are the only products we make and we work hard to make them better than anyone else. If you consider the large number of serious shooters who use nothing but Sierra and the many accuracy records held by marksmen shooting Sierra bullets, we believe we accomplish our objective of a better bullet. <br/><br/>Sierra began in 1947 in the California Quonset hut building pictured on the front cover of the reloading manual. At the time, the second world war had just ended, shooting popularity was rising to unprecedented levels and the supply of high quality ammunition was limited. Shooters were discovering that to satisfy their own demand, reloading was the answer. Frank Snow, Jim Spivy and Loren Harbor recognized this and created Sierra Bullets to help fill the void. A few years later, an accomplished competitive shooter named Martin Hull joined Sierra. Martin brought with him an understanding of the market and the ability to translate ideas into a finished product. He was the manager of our ballistics laboratory for nearly 20 years. In 1969, Bob Hayden joined Sierra as Manager of Operations for The Leisure Group, who at the time was Sierra's parent company. An engineer by trade and an avid hunter, Bob has led Sierra through years of tremendous growth while greatly expanding Sierra's product offering.<br/><br/>In 1990, Sierra left its factory in Santa Fe Springs, California for a new beginning in Sedalia, Missouri. Armed with years of experience in the manufacturing and testing of our quality bullets, Sierra designed and built one of the industry's most advanced manufacturing facilities. While integrating the best of the old with the new, we enhanced our tool and die shop, upgraded our metallurgical laboratory and quality control systems, redesigned our process for washing and polishing bullets and improved our bullet assembly equipment. Our shining star however was the construction of an underground, 300 meter, test range, the longest privately owned underground bullet test facility in the world. Without it, we would not be able to conduct the degree of accuracy testing necessary for our stringent quality control requirements, nor would we be capable of producing the reloading manuals at the level we do.<br/><br/>Another significant addition to the Sierra arsenal was the development of our Bulletsmiths service and Toll Free Tech Line. Every weekday, literally hundreds of shooters and reloaders call our toll free number and talk with one of our experienced ballistic technicians. Even if a caller is not using a Sierra bullet, our technicians are trained to have the answers to their questions about products, methods and performance. At the time of this writing, over 40,000 calls were answered in one year alone by our staff of seven. Sierra's toll free number is 800-223-8799. It is manned from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday and is available in the United States and Canada. </div> "}, "id": "VIGHYTV5AXTLSKL2"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/california/silvercrest-homes-woodland-ca", "City": "Test", "Name": "Silvercrest Homes (Woodland, CA)", "Longitude": -121.746667, "State/Province": "California", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 38.681554, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Silvercrest Online was designed especially with YOU in mind.

This process promotes a healthier forest by allowing some sunlight to reach the smaller developing trees. The freshly cut green logs (40-60% moisture content) are cut into lengths the width of the tree and split for turning. This process allows us to create up to 8 one-piece solid birch hardwood bowls ranging from 22 inches to 7 inches in diameter - all from a single split length. <br/><br/>After the bowls have been cut, they are sorted and stacked on carts for drying. The kiln drying process takes 4-6 days to complete and is the most critical step in the production process. Our progressive kiln monitors both the heat and moisture content and the bowls are removed when the moisture content reaches 6-10%. Because of our unique drying process we have less than 3% loss. <br/><br/>Each bowl is then individually sanded and branded before the finish is applied. <br/><br/>The bowls are dipped and coated with a unique blend of soybean oil, carotene, vitamin E and lemon that penetrates, conditions and seals the wood.

The introduction of the ?Babcock Test? - a method for determining the butterfat content of milk ? led to scaled pricing of milk based on fat content. Simply put, cheese factories were only willing to pay top dollar for milk with a high fat content. Thirteen farmers including our Great Grand Uncle, Henry Metzig, were upset that their milk was considered ?low fat,? and responded by starting their own cheese factory as a co-op in Zittau, Wisconsin.<br/><br/>In 1911, Henry bought out the others and formed Union Star. To close that deal, however, Henry had to make a major commitment ? agree to work on Sunday. Since the co-op had always been closed on Sunday, the local farmers? wives had been left to deal with that day?s milk production themselves. This was no small task, because Sundays were focused on preparing the family dinner and going to church. In the end, Henry agreed that it was better for one cheesemaker to go to Hell than all the farmers' wives.<br/><br/>Back in those days, there were more than 2,800 small cheese factories scattered across Wisconsin. Today, there are only a handful of these factories still in operation. Our family?s continued success is due, in part, to the cheesemaking?s own version of women?s liberation.<br/><br/><br/>Henry?s daughter, Edna, was one of the first women to become a licensed cheesemaker and work in a factory setting. It was no surprise that soon after marrying local cheesemaker Eugene Lehman, they were running the Union Star factory. What did surprise the neighbors, however, was when they opened a small retail storefront. You see, cheesemakers back then were not known for dealing well with customers.<br/><br/>My wife, Jan, and I bought Union Star from Great Aunt Edna in 1980. I had a degree in accounting and, just like my Great Grand Uncle, wanted to run my own business. The family tradition of independent cheesemaking carried the day and we?ve been here ever since. Today, our sons are also part of the Union Star story.<br/><br/>Over the years, we?ve added new cheeses to our line and obtained new equipment. Our dedication to quality, however, has remained the same. We still purchase top quality milk from local dairy farms and turn it into premium cheeses.<br/><br/>If you?d like to taste some of the finest Wisconsin cheeses, see a real cheese factory in operation, or learn more about how cheese is made, come on in and see us.<br/> </div> "}, "id": "VYUEXWTDCO6FFVB6"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/alaska/alaskan-brewing", "City": "Test", "Name": "Alaskan Brewing", "Longitude": -134.489903, "State/Province": "Alaska", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 58.356871, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " Soon after gold was discovered in 1881, breweries in the new town of Juneau began quenching the thirst of hardy Alaskan miners. By 1903 at least four breweries had begun operation in the twin cities of Juneau and Douglas. Between 1899 and 1907, local residents enjoyed a particularly fine brew created by the Douglas City Brewing Company. Almost 100 years later, Alaskan Amber Beer, based on that same historic recipe, has started a small gold rush of its own. <br/>In 1986, the Alaskan Brewing Company became the 67th operating brewery in the United States and the only one in Alaska. Since that time our products have brought home more than 25 major medals and awards, including \"Best Beer in the Nation\" in the 1988 Great American Beer Festival Consumer Preference Poll. <br/><br/>The popularity of our beers has led to heroic efforts to keep up with the demand. We claim the unofficial record for production on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week. The addition of a new, 100 barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve the entire Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>Brewing beer in Alaska isn't easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word. <br/><br/>We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn't dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all seems worthwhile if you can go home to a dinner of king crab or fresh halibut. <br/><br/>Visitors to Alaskan Brewing hear about the history of brewing in Alaska and the 100 year old recipe that inspired our flagship Alaskan Amber Beer.

Known for its outstanding taste, unmatched freshness and superior quality, the bread was carefully baked each day, and delivered ? still warm from the oven ? in wicker laundry baskets to a growing number of customers residing in and around neighboring Youngstown, Ohio. <br/> <br/>Building A Business On The Finest Bread<br/><br/>In just a few short years, the reputation of Schwebel's bread spread far and wide. The bakery's customer list continued to expand, and delivery operations now depended on horse and wagon ? instead of wicker baskets ? to deliver the oven-fresh bread.<br/><br/>In 1914, Dora and Joseph entered the world of retail sales by working out agreements with several local ?mom and pop? stores ? a move that opened up new and more profitable sales channels for their fledgling business. To ensure that fresh bread was in the stores when customers asked for it, the young couple added more bakers to assist the family, and even hired the company's first driver/salesperson to complement the horse and wagon.<br/><br/>The strong economy of the 1920's kept operations humming along, and more and more people experienced the taste and quality of Schwebel's bread. In 1923, the Schwebel's invested $25,000 and built a small bakery complete with a store front for retail business. At this time, the family could bake and deliver 1,000 loaves a day using six delivery trucks. The bakery was on the move and the future looked bright. Unfortunately, tragedy was just around the corner. In 1928, Joseph Schwebel died suddenly at the age of 46 ? leaving Dora with six children and the family's business to run by herself.<br/><br/>Challenges And Difficult Decisions<br/><br/>In 1928, many people believed the baking business was no place for a woman with young children. Dora Schwebel was told she should sell her bakery and stay home with her children, but she wouldn't hear of it. Instead, she stared down the naysayers and decided to carry on with the business she helped to build with her husband. Against all odds, Dora forged ahead to keep her family thriving. <br/><br/>The stock market crashed in the fall of 1929, less than a year after Joseph Schwebel's passing, and Dora and her young family found out just how difficult running a business could be.<br/><br/>Vowing to meet her obligations by working all day and all night if necessary, Dora skillfully negotiated a number of critical agreements that kept the business running in the face of national financial ruin. She built a new bakery in 1936 that doubled production and improved efficiency, and added to it in 1938 and again in 1941. And through it all, she found the time and financial resources to help the less fortunate. <br/><br/>By the late 1940's, demand for the company's products was growing by leaps and bounds as soldiers returned home from World War II and the baby boom began. <br/><br/>Riding The Wave Of Success In The Fifties And Sixties<br/><br/>In 1951, Dora and her children moved into their ?million-dollar bakery,? a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility on Youngstown's Midlothian Boulevard, outfitted with equipment and baking processes that would transform the Schwebel family's baking business. <br/><br/>The family, proud of the new bakery, and thankful to suppliers and local citizens who enthusiastically supported the big move, planned elaborate Grand Opening festivities. The Schwebel's invited the entire community to tour the modern bakery and celebrate with the family. The new bakery allowed the company to continue expanding product lines and distribution channels. <br/><br/>The 1960's marked the beginning of the third generation's active participation in the company. Their entry would add vitality, new ideas, and a quest for rapid growth and expansion outside of Youngstown. In 1967, the popularity of Schwebel's Golden Rich Bread led to a successful national licensing program throughout the country.<br/><br/>Extending The Reach Of Great Taste<br/><br/>By the end of the 1970's, the company had noticeably expanded its distribution network. In rapid fashion, Schwebel's had now become a key player in the Canton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland, Ohio markets. In addition, the company had undertaken a significant bakery expansion program that fully automated the bread and buns lines, doubling capacity.<br/><br/>Record growth characterized the 1980's and 1990's. As a result of several key acquisitions, Schwebel's had become a regional force in the baking industry. To complement this expansion the company added distribution facilities in Columbus, Ohio and Buffalo, New York. This period also heralded special baking agreements with Stouffer's, Pillsbury, and Walt Disney's Epcot Center.<br/><br/>Growing The Company Into The Future<br/><br/>For more than 100 years after its humble beginnings in a suburban Youngstown kitchen, Schwebel Baking Company continues to produce the breads people ask for by name. With more than 1,400 team members dedicated to maintaining the company's standards of quality, freshness, and honest hard work, the Schwebel family makes sure that customers get nothing short of great taste every time. Joseph and Dora wouldn't have it any other way. </div> "}, "id": "W5UH3HKADTCJMX5K"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/california/wiebe-farms", "City": "Test", "Name": "Wiebe Farms", "Longitude": -119.454104, "State/Province": "California", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 36.560751, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " WELCOME!

From the landmark Conner Bottling Works, in Newfields, New Hampshire, the Conner Family has for the past five generations been producing and bottling \"Squamscot Old Fashioned Beverages\". Known more commonly today as a tonic or soda, the many flavors of Squamscot Beverages has been quenching the thirst of New Englander's for more than one hundred and forty one years.<br/><br/>Established in 1863 by the late William H. Conner, the bottling works started producing tonic that was simply called \"Connermade\". This tonic, which was really a \"pop\" beer or more commonly known as a spruce beer at the time, was packaged in returnable glass bottles with porcelain and wire stoppers. William Conner grew the business until his death in 1911. Only to be succeded by his son Alfred Conner Sr., who ran the business from 1911-1948, followed by Alfred Conner Jr. who was raised around the bottling plant, which is located on the family farm. A two-story, gray and white building constructed in the 1800's that was once a barn and is located directly behind the family home.<br/><br/> In 1911 the business was producing just 4,115 cases of tonic a year. While small profits were made from 1912 to 1916 the business has enjoyed an unbroken time of prosperity since 1917. Especially during the years of National Prohibition that created a great boost in the tonic business and made Squamscot Gingerale the outstanding drink in New England. Growing the bottling works to nearly 26,000 cases and 14 flavors in 1930, when the label was finally changed to \"Squamscot Beverages\". In 1938, Alfred Conner Sr. purchased their first modern bottling machine. Better known today as, \"Dixie\". This bottling machine remains in the exact spot from when it was delivered to the plant and is still in use today.<br/><br/>As Word War II started Alfred Conner Jr. left the homestead and served for four years in the Navy, only to return and run the business from 1948 to 1979, and can still be seen strolling around the plant even today. The operation is now run by Alfred's son Tom, and his son Dan Conner. Trying to keep with tradition, and personally delivering their Squamscot Beverages to customers around the Seacoast. They use a couple of distributors for other parts of New Hampshire.<br/><br/>A unique feature and one that few bottling companies have in this country is the presence of an artesian well within the plant. Many years ago Alfred Sr. conceived the idea of having the well within the plant, even though there was a satisfactory supply piped in from the outside. So he drilled for the well and eventually sank one at 123 feet. The water flow into the well is twenty gallons per minute and the water is reputed to be of super quality. One reason Alfred Sr. attributed the great success of his tonics, is due to this splendid water supply.<br/><br/>While on the second floor a smell reminiscent of melting popsicles greets visitors in the rustic but impeccably clean and ordered syrup room, where the main laboratory for manufacturing and mixing of the syrup recipes are generated and have been passed down for generations. From the 20 plus vibrant colored flavors developed by the Conner's over the years, only the best products, like Jamaican ginger for the Gingerale, are used to help ensure their distinct taste.<br/><br/>Within the syrup room a 60-gallon glass lined steel tank is used as a pasteurizer. Steam cooking sugar and water to a temperature of 180 degrees and allowed to remain for a certain length of time, before the correct amount of extract is added. This process assures an \"even\" quality of sweetness and does much to assure quality for the simple syrup.<br/> <br/>When the syrup is ready, it is then piped downstairs, where the bottling or, \"Dixie\" comes to life. Synchronized with a conveyor of glass bottles, carbonated well water and syrup, a distinct rhythmic sound of clacks and clangs takes place to fill and crown each bottle. Bottling is usually done every afternoon and with the help of just one additional employee, over 60 cases an hour of any one flavor can be processed when business is brisk.<br/><br/>The last step is a homespun example of quality testing and control. The bottles are plucked from the collection table and tipped end over end to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Every once in while a bottles is opened and tasted to ensure the quality of the batch stays consistent. Each bottle is then hand placed in cases ready for shipping and distribution.<br/><br/>Getting ready to celebrate their 142nd year in business, and recognized as one of \"New Hampshire's Own\" the Conner family continues it's tradition of making Squamscot Old Fashioned Beverages as the last independent bottler in the state of New Hampshire. They hope you can \"Experience the Past... One Sip at a Time\"! </div> "}, "id": "W98I7QO4VWADPZ5C"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/arizona/the-peanut-patch", "City": "Test", "Name": "The Peanut Patch", "Longitude": -114.558566, "State/Province": "Arizona", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 32.640858, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " The tour of The Peanut Patch, will teach you how peanuts are processed and stored. <br/><br/>One of the highlights, of course, is the roasting area.

The industrious and inventive microbrewery located on the Milwaukee River has become a Milwaukee landmark. Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Beginnings<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim. Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by giving him a book on the subject. To Russ? surprise, Jim read the book and brewed the beer. According to Russ, Jim was not known as a gourmet cook, but he made a good beer. Russ was impressed, but decided he could brew one better. In short, sibling rivalry and common interest lead both to begin entering beer making contests and winning awards. It wasn?t long before family and friends encouraged them turn their hobby into a business.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> The Klisch family has roots in the beer industry: their grandfather worked for Schlitz, driving a street sweeper and a truck. Russ Klisch remembers his grandfather bringing home short fills to his dad. As a kid, he remembers thinking, ?it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.? Several family members also owned taverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business. They decided to start small and chose a location that they could walk to from their home. Initially, they bought an old bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest, at 818 East Cambers St. and began brewing with stainless steel 55 gal drums and used dairy equipment. On December 2, 1987 they sold their first barrel of beer at the Gorden Park Pub. With the brewery now up and running, the infamous tour started soon after!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> As Lakefront Brewery?s popularity grew, so did their production: by 1988, sales jumped to 72 barrels; by 1989, 125 barrels; and sales began doubling after that. In 1990, owner Russ Klisch built his own bottling machine and started bottling their beer. As the brewery expanded, more used equipment was brought in to meet the demand. Once, a food critic, who was visiting the brewery, commented that they had a ?Frankenstein operation.? He explained that it was called a Frankenstein operation because all their brewing equipment has lived and died in a previous life. By 1998, the production had reached almost 3000 barrels in their small 60? X 60? space and the brewery had over grown their current space.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>1872 N. Commerce Street<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> The search was on for a new location and the City of Milwaukee had a building to sell on the Milwaukee River. In 1908 this building was built to house the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Co. coal fired power plant and later sold to the City to house their City Forestry Department. But in 1998 the City was considering tearing down the old power plant location to uphold a contract with a nearby apartment complex unless a non-industrial business would be interested in the location. At the same time, demand for Lakefront?s innovative beers was increasing. Jim and Russ concluded that they had outgrown the little bakery, and that it was time to move on. They looked all over, but decided on this location when the city of Milwaukee recommended the site. The city said beer making would be an appropriate industry, and it allowed them to save the building and support a new local business. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> The move was completed and additions were made to both the building and brewery. In 1999 the Lakefront Brewery Palm Garden started and in 2000, a real brew house was added to the brewery. Production has increased through out the years and by 2008 had reached 11,000 barrels. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Innovators<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> The Klisch brothers and their employees are not only great brewers, but they pride themselves on innovation within their industry.<br/><br/> First, Lakefront Brewery was the first beer company to bottle fruit beer since prohibition, starting in 1992 with their seasonal Lakefront Cherry Beer. The beer was created with an old home brewing recipe and a love for Door County cherries. It?s now an annual staple at the brewery.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Second, and very important to the owners, they were the first certified organic beer to be labeled in the U.S. starting in 1996 with their Lakefront Organic E.S.B. (extra special bitter). The ale is brewed using 100% organic malt and hops. Russ Klisch believed this was the right thing to do for the environment. He?s so passionate about his cause that he?s started a partnership with Wisconsin farmers to grow organic hops in his home state. Currently, the hops are imported primarily from New Zealand, but Klisch and his company hope their partnership with local farmers will provide the market to support their business and others interested in organic products. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Third, in 2006 the brothers changed the government?s policy definition of beer, which stated all beer had to be made with 25% malted barley. The company, aware that people with celiac disease are intolerant to wheat, wanted to create a gluten-free beer. They approached the government and got the policy changed so that they could sell and market their gluten-free beer, New Grist. New Grist is brewed from sorghum, hops, water, rice and gluten-free yeast grown on molasses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Finally, in May of 2007, The Wisconsin Department of Tourism announced that Lakefront Brewery had become the first brewery in the state and the first business in the City of Milwaukee to receive the Travel Green Wisconsin certification. Travel Green Wisconsin recognizes tourism-related businesses that are reducing their environmental impact through operational and other improvements. To achieve Travel Green certification, businesses must meet several goals including demonstration of how they encourage staff and vendors to be environmentally aware and how they reduce their waste and energy consumption. Lakefront demonstrates this each Friday at 3:30 p.m. with an environmental tour by brewery president, Russ Klisch. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Palm Garden<br/><br/><br/> Starting in late 1999, Russ Davis heard the Klisch brothers wanted to utilize the large banquet hall in their brewery and approached the company, saying that he wanted to rent out the space. The Klisch brothers were interested, but concerned about competing with customers in the area who sold their beer. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Through compromise and creativity, they decided to create a family restaurant environment. On Fridays, the Palm Garden offers their famous fish fry. They also host private events, like weddings, there on Saturday evenings. It?s a way to utilize the space while still supporting the local business that carry and sell their beer. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Tour<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> The infamous tour is as unique as the brewery and has a constant evolution in style and delivery. To begin with, Lakefront Brewery, Inc. thought it was odd to wait until the end of a tour to drink a beer. They believe there is a direct correlation between attention span on beer tours and drinking beer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Lakefront believes people want to go on brewery tours for three main reasons: drink beer, be entertained, and see the place. So, to meet their philosophy, the company provides beer at the start of the tour, shares jokes along the way, and still manages to explain the brewing process and history of Lakefront. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Many people on staff give the tour, and there is no specific script. Employees are encouraged to remember certain highlights, but mostly to add their own style and jokes to entertain guests along the way. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Historical Preservation<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> Lakefront Brewery, Inc. is the proud owner of Bernie Brewer?s Chalet. When the Brewer?s rebuilt their new stadium, the Chalet needed a new home, and the Klisch brothers wanted that home to be in their brewery. Russ Klisch jumped at the opportunity to buy the item. It is a great part of their tour, and offers folks a piece of history in their own hometown.<br/><br/><br/> Many people also remark on the unique lights that hang in the Palm Garden. The lights were originally designed and hung in the Plankinton Hotel in 1916 for a beer garden. The hotel was dedicated on the same day as the start of the First World War. Shortly thereafter, prohibition started and, in short, the beer garden was never used as a beer garden. The lights hung in a restaurant in the hotel until 1982 when the building was demolished. The city of Milwaukee stored them in an architecturally valuable warehouse until the Klisch brothers bid and won them. They have spent over $1,000 renovating each light, and they are very proud of their heritage and beauty. </div> "}, "id": "XJ5IJ0B8FUT2FLR8"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/texas/wimberley-glass-works", "City": "Test", "Name": "Wimberley Glass Works", "Longitude": -98.044128, "State/Province": "Texas", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 29.917225, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Tim de Jong established Wimberley Glass Works in 1992.

And these gloves have met that promise. <br/><br/>For nearly three-quarters of a century, young players have dreamed about owning their first Nokona glove. Shown in his Alvin, Texas Little League uniform in the late 1950s (above), Nolan Ryan had just gotten his new Nokona glove at Alvin Hardware Store where his dad had taken him to shop. \"You knew you had arrived, when you were able to get a Nokona glove,\" Ryan admitted. \"They asked me if I wanted the more modern kind of glove and I had seen some older pictures of ballplayers, so I chose the older style.\"<br/><br/>Nokona resisted importing its gloves when nearly every glove maker did so, or simply went out of business, like many did, in the 1960s. It preferred to keep its workers on the job, though it was penalized trying to keep its costs in line with far cheaper foreign-made gloves. <br/><br/>The company also had to drop the skyrocketing endorsements from major league players by the early 1970s. \"I think, along with the cheaper imports and the continued escalation of player endorsements, if we'd chosen to stay with it, would have shut our doors,\" says today's Nocona president, Robby Storey. \"We concentrated instead on putting our money and effort toward producing the best ball gloves we could make and trusted that our loyal dealers and customers would stick with us. Many of them did. <br/><br/>\"There's something to be said for a two-way loyalty between the seller and the buyer, an implicit trust,\" Mr. Storey says. \"One that guarantees our continuation as a reputable firm and the belief from our customer that he's got a product that has served him well and he can rely upon in the future.\" <br/><br/>During the tour you will be able to see all the aspects of a glove being made from the cutting to the finished product. <br/> </div> "}, "id": "XVVCEA6HN3VVX8U0"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/minnesota/august-schell-brewing-company", "City": "Test", "Name": "August Schell Brewing Company", "Longitude": -94.448509, "State/Province": "Minnesota", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 44.290221, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Food Production", "Description": " At Schell's, we believe that not all beer is created equal.

Built in the style of mills that operated in the Delaware Valley of Pennsylvania and in the Midlands area of England, the mill operates with millstones imported from France and high-quality 18th century milling machinery purchased by Ford?s antiques buyers. <br/><br/>The Mill ground its first grain on Thanksgiving Day 1929 with local miller Erwin Smith of Hopkinton turning the iron wheel to open the floodgates and set the millstones into operation. For many years, the Mill produced corn, wheat, and rye for the Inn and the Wayside Inn Boys School that Ford operated on the property. When Henry Ford died in 1947, the Mill ceased operations and Ford family representatives began selling off the land he had accumulated until the Wayside Inn property was back to its original 125-acre parcel. <br/><br/>Pepperidge Farm postcard In 1952, the Mill began full operations again.

As a Pepperidge Farm employee, the Miller operated and maintained the Mill, provided educational tours to thousands of visitors, and promoted Pepperidge Farm products which were on display in the Mill. When the Inn re-opened in June 1958 after a devastating fire and thorough restoration, Margaret Rudkin, a friend and neighbor of one of the leading preservationists, provided Pepperidge Farm cookies as dessert to the dining dignitaries.

His goal: to brew exceptional ales and lagers. Today, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company is considered the premier craft brewery in the United States. And the beer? Critics proclaim it ?Among the best brewed anywhere in the world.? <br/> <br/>Ken?s passion for brewing began when a friend showed him the basics of home brewing. Using homemade equipment, Ken began brewing five-gallon batches of beer on his own, and soon became a proficient home brewer. <br/><br/>In 1976, after studying chemistry and physics at Butte Community College and California State University at Chico, Ken opened his own store, The Home Brew Shop. There, he supplied Chico?s home-brewing community with equipment, materials, and advice, but dreamed of opening his own brewery.<br/> <br/>Two years later, it was time to make the dream a reality. Ken and co-founder Paul Camusi cobbled a brewery together from dairy tanks, a soft-drink bottler, and equipment salvaged from defunct breweries. Though the equipment was secondhand, they created a first-rate microbrewery. The ingredients were premium, including the copious quantities of hops that would become the brewery?s trademark. An avid backpacker, Ken named the new company for his favorite hiking grounds?the Sierra Nevada mountains. <br/> <br/>Finally, on November 15, 1980, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company brewed the first batch of what would soon become a landmark in American craft brewing: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. <br/><br/>Word spread quickly, and over the next decade the demand for Sierra Nevada brews soon exceeded the brewery?s modest brewing capacity. Despite nearly constant additions to the brewery, Ken was soon back at the drawing board, planning a new brewery. In 1989, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company moved to its current site. <br/> <br/>Ken traveled to Germany and brought back a traditional 100-barrel copper brew house, which became the heart of the new brewery. This met demand for a while, but the brewery soon needed to expand again. In 1997, Ken commissioned the original coppersmiths to match new kettles to the originals, bringing the brewery?s total capacity to almost eight hundred thousand barrels per year. <br/><br/>Building the new brewery afforded Sierra Nevada the opportunity to create two stunning showcases, both featuring exceptional dining, live music, and its award-winning beers. The elegant Sierra Nevada Taproom and Restaurant has become a destination in its own right. With mouthwatering lunch and dinner menus, an impressive dining room, and a large outdoor dining patio, it offers distinctive, contemporary cuisine as well as an opportunity to sample the brewery?s entire line of premium ales and lagers, including hard-to-find specialty drafts. The 350-seat Big Room?a beautifully designed live music and multi-purpose room?was constructed on the west end of the brewery to feature live music events for all ages and is a perfect facility for weddings, reunions, and business conferences.<br/><br/>To this day, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company remains true to its roots. Ken is still personally involved in every aspect of brewery operation. Most importantly, the Sierra Nevada commitment to quality remains the same. Premium ingredients and time-honored brewing techniques make Sierra Nevada ales and lagers truly exceptional beers. </div> "}, "id": "YQWGLMOTJN0DU7ZV"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/colorado/invesco-field-at-mile-high", "City": "Test", "Name": "INVESCO Field at Mile High", "Longitude": -104.992259, "State/Province": "Colorado", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 39.74001, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Misc", "Description": " The Broncos' new home is located in the vicinity of Mile High Stadium, just west of Interstate-25.

Obsession. Obsession with flavor. Obsession with innovation. Obsession over fusing the two to craft the very best chocolate, from bean to bar.<br/><br/>The obsession begins at origin. We don't just buy good beans, we help make the best beans. TCHOSource is our unique sourcing program, designed to obtain the best beans in the world while enabling the producers of those beans to earn a better living.<br/><br/>We go beyond fair trade (which we also support) to partner directly with growers. We help them improve the genetics of their plants, improve their cacao fermentation by redesigning their fermentaria, and improve cacao drying by designing new drying racks. We also provide them flavor labs where they can actually make chocolate ? for many, this is the first time they taste chocolate made from their own beans. Then we provide sensory training so we can speak a common language about the results of their efforts. And finally, we link it all together in a common, cloud-based database ? called Cropster ? where we can share the results of all our efforts in real time. All to enable our partners to produce the exceptional, flavor-driven cacao that we pay premium prices for, so we can make seriously superior chocolate ? New American Chocolate.<br/><br/>Integral to New American Chocolate are our recipes, and that brings us to Beta. Beta is TCHO's obsession with co-creating our chocolates with our customers. How? After our own intensive development process, we invite you to taste our efforts, give us online feedback, then incorporate that feedback to iterate new versions ? which we invite you to taste and react to again. Rise and repeat. This program has resulted in our creating with your feedback thousands of recipe iterations over the years, resulting in the extraordinary chocolates we proudly craft every day. Beta isn't the way making chocolate is normally done, but normal never leads to extraordinary. And New American Chocolate is definitely extraordinary.<br/><br/>Extraordinary is re-imagining what it means to taste chocolate, as represented by our dark and milk Flavor Wheels. Because chocolate isn't just one flavor, savoring chocolate is a journey for your intellect and emotions, as well as your senses. At TCHO, we believe that journey should go beyond percentages and origins ? which can be incomplete, even deceptive descriptors ? which is why we created PureNotes dark chocolate. PureNotes explore the pure flavors inherent in cacao beans themselves, nothing added. For example, the hints of red berry in our PureNotes \"Fruity\" (single origin sourced from Peru), or bright acids like in mandarin oranges in our \"Citrus\" (from Madagascar), or the deep, hearty richness in our \"Chocolatey\" (Ghana), or subtlety of roasted nuts in our \"Nutty\" (Ecuador). Likewise, milk chocolate isn't one flavor either, which is why we created SeriousMilk. Our first two SeriousMilks explore the caramel notes that come from heating milk and sugar in our Classic, as well as the underlying chocolate in our Cacao.<br/><br/>So yes, we are obsessed. We're obsessed with making a better world. We obsess over where our cacao comes from and how our growers are involved. We're obsessed with finding the perfect recipe for our chocolate. We're obsessed with creating an experience that delights. But, most of all, we're obsessed with you. We want you to rediscover chocolate like never before. You?our partners, our growers, our co-creators, our friends. You are our inspiration, our motivation, our true obsession. </div> "}, "id": "Z540G82YZBZLS5P7"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/new-mexico/intel-visitors-center-new-mexico", "City": "Test", "Name": "Intel Visitors Center (New Mexico)", "Longitude": -106.648639, "State/Province": "New\u00a0Mexico", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 35.08418, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Electronics, Computers and Transportation", "Description": " Our employees manufacture and test some of the most sophisticated products the world has ever seen.

In honor of the occasion, President Bill Clinton, who was Governor of Arkansas at the time, played a few tunes on his saxophone as it rained and rained. Sam noted that it had also rained on that day 40 years before. <br/><br/>When Sam's original store became available as the site for the Visitors Center, it was purchased by the company and completely demolished inside. The only original thing remaining was the floor, which was Mr. Sam's favorite thing. He used to joke that he was never able to keep it as pretty as it is in the Visitors Center. <br/><br/>After years in a box, we were able to bring Mrs. Walton's wedding dress back to life.

They would spend the summers in the resort town of Mackinac Island, Michigan, where they also had a shop, and the winters here in Daytona Beach. At the start of WWII, they had to close the shop in Michigan.<br/><br/>While I have told this story thousands of times, I?m still amazed every time I think about it. First of all, I doubt that many women in the 20?s were able to start a business. On top of that, these gutsy ladies were making chocolates in Florida before the invention of air conditioning! Somehow, they were able to make the business flourish. Their passion and determination to make quality chocolates started a tradition that has lasted for 80 years.<br/><br/>New Owners, but the Same Passion for Excellence<br/>===============================================<br/>Neither of these women had any children. So in 1953, when it was time to retire, they sold the business to Ed and Helen Resinger, who had just moved here from Ohio.<br/><br/>The Resingers continued the commitment to quality. They doubled the size of the operation and added items covered in milk chocolate. As the reputation grew, meeting the demand at certain times of the year became a real challenge. By the late seventies, they would have to quit taking orders by the middle of December because they could not keep up. The lack of supply lead to a chance meeting between my dad and Mr. Resinger. One year Dad hadn?t gotten his order in on time and he was desperately pleading his case. After some serious negotiation he was able to get the chocolates he needed and he told Mr. Resinger, ?If you ever want to sell this business, let me know.?<br/><br/>A Boyhood Dream Comes True<br/>==========================<br/>The Resingers had no children, so when they decided to retire, they called Dad to see if he was still interested. Dad jumped at the chance ?to own that candy shop on Beach Street.?<br/><br/>Dad was way too busy with his medical practice to get directly involved with the chocolate business, so he enlisted my brother Chuck, our uncle Sonny Mathis and myself. At the time, I was an out of work social worker, and my brother had just finished college. Chuck was a good cook, so he learned how to make chocolates. I concentrated on sales and Sonny helped out with the accounting. Mr. Resinger worked with us for several months to ensure the quality and consistency was maintained. This was a very difficult time for everybody. Mr. Resinger had always been hands-on and had mixed feelings about giving up control. I?ll never forget the first complaint we got. A customer called and said, ?That the chocolate doesn?t taste the same since you changed owners.? The funny thing was that we had yet to make a single batch of candy on our own.<br/><br/>Keeping the Torch of Tradition Aglow<br/>====================================<br/>We were very young and inexperienced and I?m sure it showed. From the very beginning, we were mindful of the importance of Angell &amp; Phelps to the community, and we were determined to carry on the tradition. What we lacked in experience, we made up with hard work and a lot of passion that was instilled into us by our parents. As time went on, our mother, Ann, got involved and put her artistic skills to work doing merchandising and design.<br/><br/>Knowing that we needed to expand in 1984, we opened a second location in Ormond Beach. The store was located next to another long-standing local business, Billy?s Tap Room. It remained there for many years until we moved it to the Granada Plaza. This extra location helped to relieve the problem that we had with running out of chocolates at Christmas. However, we were in desperate need of a bigger kitchen to keep up with demand.<br/><br/>In 1985, we made the decision to build a new factory in the New Smyrna Beach Industrial Park. This was done with the thought of opening stores in the Orlando area. Unfortunately, the store in Orlando didn?t work out. It was a real learning experience, you might say.<br/><br/>Back to Where We Started<br/>========================<br/>In 1995, we decided to buy the old Dunn Brothers Hardware/Toy store building on Beach Street and move the factory back downtown. The city was getting ready to put in a multimillion-dollar streetscape to help revitalize the downtown and the timing seemed right to make a change.<br/><br/>We configured the factory with a viewing hallway so we could market the chocolate factory as a tourist attraction for the millions of visitors that come to the area every year.<br/><br/>It has been very popular with tourists and locals alike. Many travel writers throughout the world have written about us. In 2004, Southern Living Magazine named us one of the \"2004 Best Food Finds!\"<br/><br/>At the same time we moved the chocolate factory, we relocated the New Smyrna store to Canal Street. The New Smyrna store has a very loyal local following. The area has a real small town feel to it and the customers are the nicest people you will ever meet. It reminds me of something out of the ?Andy Griffith? show.<br/><br/>In 1999 we expanded into the restaurant business when we added the Angell &amp; Phelps Caf\u00e9 next to the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Long Live the Commitment to Quality!<br/>====================================<br/>Modern technology has certainly changed the candy business. Through the years we have seen many of our fellow candy makers switch to cheaper ingredients and find easier, less expensive ways to make their candy. We?ve always been mindful of the commitment to quality started by Ms. Angell &amp; Ms. Phelps and have resisted any changes that would diminished that commitment. For the most part, we are still doing things the old fashioned way. Our feeling is that our customers would rather have us raise the price then compromise the quality. I feel confident that those two gutsy ladies who started this tradition would feel the same way and I imagine they?re proud of the way things have turned out. </div> "}, "id": "ZQ3YGCEJZDI6X1NQ"}, {"createdTime": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "fields": {"Website": "http://www.factorytoursusa.com/state/oregon/silvercrest-homes-woodburn-or", "City": "Test", "Name": "Silvercrest Homes (Woodburn, OR)", "Longitude": -122.858844, "State/Province": "Oregon", "End Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Latitude": 45.14226, "Start Date/Time": "2019-02-13T16:32:38", "Type": "Wood, Leather and Paper", "Description": " Silvercrest Online was designed especially with YOU in mind.

The molds for our candles are taken from antique glassware dating from 1820 to around 1940. Specially formulated heat-resistant Oklahoma paraffin wax is poured into the mold and rotated by hand to form a wax shell. The shell is then filled with softer, richly scented wax. All in all the process takes nearly two days to complete. When the candle is lit, the scented inner wax burns slowly to the bottom releasing its aromatic fragrance. Light glows softly through the colored, patterned exterior, and the shell remains to be refilled and enjoyed over and over again.<br/><br/>We take pride in our candles and are confident that you will enjoy them as much as we do. Stock up for yourself or buy them for a friend! A Keepsake\u00ae Candle is sure to be a treasured gift.
