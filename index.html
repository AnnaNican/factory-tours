	<h1>Factory Tours</h1>
	<h2>walkabouts around U.S.A. factories</h2>
<p>Factories are these magical buildings that produce things, lot’s of the things that satisfy our cravings, keep economy running and are the pride and (in most cases) the state of the development nations. They don’t always have the prettiest architecture and for me personally, the word “factory” is associated with black and white pictures of dull and tired workers standing in line to punch their cards. Over the years they have been transitioning from symbols of industrial revolutions to scapegoats of climate change.  Lot’s of things changed in the factories - including the pure fact that there are less and less humans working there and some factories.
This projects summarizes factories in US.</p>
